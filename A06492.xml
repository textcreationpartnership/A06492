            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N fewe wordes to declare what is to be ſayd for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of this worke, although in fewe wordes all can not be expreſſed that may be ſaid, yet briefly to ſignifie that may ſuffice, this much we thought good to certifie thee, godly reader: that amongeſt many other godly engliſh bookes in theſe our daies printed and tranſlated, thou ſhalt finde but fewe, wherein either thy time ſhall ſeeme better beſtowed, or thy labour better recompenſed to the profite of thy ſoule, or wherein thou mayeſt ſee the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and veine of S. Paule more liuely repreſented to thee, then in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent reading of this preſent commentary vpon the epiſtle of S. Paule to the Galathians. In which, as in a myrrour or glaſſe, or rather as S. Stephen in the heauens being opened, thou mayſt ſee and behold the admirable glory of the Lord and all the riches of heauen, thy ſaluation freely and onely by faith in Chriſte, his loue and grace toward thee ſo opened, thy victory and conqueſt in him ſo proued, the wrath of God ſo pacified, his lawe ſatiſfied, the full kingdome of life ſet open, death, hell and hell gates, be they neuer ſo ſtronge, with all the power of ſinne, fleſh and the world vanquiſhed, thy conſcience diſcharged, all feares and terrours remoued, thy ſpirituall man ſo refreſhed and ſet at libertie, that either thy heart muſt be heuier then lead, or the reading hereof will lift thee vppe aboue thy ſelfe, and giue thee to knowe that of Chriſte Ieſu, that thy ſelfe ſhalt ſay thou neuer kneweſt before, though before thou kneweſt him right well.</p>
            <p>Such ſpiritual comfort, ſuch heauenly doctrine, ſuch experience and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of conſcience herein is contained, ſuch triumphing ouer Sathan and al his power infernall, ſuch contempt of the lawe compared with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſuch an holy pride and exaltation of the beleuinge man (whom here he maketh a perſon diuine, the Sonne of God, the heire of the whole earth,
<pb facs="tcp:9456:4"/>
conquerour of the world, of ſinne of death and the deuill) with ſuch phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and speeches of high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation, of Chriſt, of grace, of iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and of faith (which faith, ſaith he, tranſfigureth a man into Chriſt, and coupleth him more nere vnto Chriſt then the huſband is coupled to his wife, and maketh a man more then a man), with ſuch other mighty voices, full of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall glory and maieſtie, as the like hath not bene vſed lightly of any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſince the Apoſtles time, neither durſt he euer haue vſed the ſame him ſelfe, had not greate experience and exerciſe of conſcience by inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictes and profound agonies framed him thereunto, and miniſtred to him both this knowledge of ſpirite and boldenes of ſpeech.</p>
            <p>And this commonly is the working and proceeding of Godes vocation, euer to worke thinges by the contrary: of infidelitie to make faith, of pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to make riches, in miſery to ſhew mercye, to turne ſorrowe to ſolace, mourning to mirth, from afflictions to aduaunce to glory, from hell to bring to heauen from death to life, from darkenes to light, from thraldome to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,<note place="margin">Samuul. 1. Eſay. 41. 1. Cor. 1.</note> in wildernes to geue waters, the barren to make frutefull, of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that be not to make thinges to be, briefely to make all thinges of nought. Thus began God firſt to worke, thus he proceeded, thus he continueth, and ſo will to the worldes ende. The firſte ſeede of promiſe next to Eue, was geuen to Sara: yet in what caſe was Eue before ſhe had the promiſe? And in vvhat barrennes and deſpaire vvas Sara before ſhe enioyed her welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Iſaac? The like is to be ſaid of the two mothers of two moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent children Samuel &amp; Iohn Baptiſte, and yet what griefes &amp; ſorrowes paſt ouer their heartes, being both paſt all hope in nature, before the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God did worke? Howe longe did Iacob the Patriarke ſerue in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thraldome for his Rachel? In what excellent glorye was Ioſeph ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted? yet what ſuffered he before of his brethren, and how longe impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? In what and howe longe ſeruitude were the ſonnes of Iſraell before Moſes was ſent vnto them? and afterward in what diſtreſſe were they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed on euery ſide whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſea was forced to geue them place? After that againe, what an excellent land was promiſed and geuen vnto them, flowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with milke and hony? but how were they ſcourged before in the deſert, and yet neither had they the lande, but their children? To ouerpaſſe many thinges here by the way, what an excellent worke was it of God to ſet vppe Dauid in his kingedome? Alſo what excellent promiſes were geuen to his throne? Yet how hardly eſcaped he with life? howe did the Lord mortifie and frame him to his hand before he placed him in quiet? Infinite it were to recite all. Briefely, in all the works of God this is vſuall to be ſeene, that he worketh euermore moſt excellent thinges by inſtrumentes moſt humble,
<pb facs="tcp:9456:4"/>
and which ſeeme moſt furdeſt of. Which of al the Apoſtles did euer thinke, when Chriſt was ſo humbled and crucified vppon the tree, that they ſhould euer ſee him againe? although he foretold them of his riſing before: in ſo muche that Thomas did ſcarſely beleeue when he with his eies ſawe him. What man would euer haue thought that Paule in the raging heate of his perſecuting ſpirite would haue turned from a perſecuter to ſuch a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor? from ſuch infidelitie to ſuch a faith? in ſo much that Ananias woulde ſcarſely beleue the Lord when he tolde him. Such is the omnipotencie of the Lorde our God, euer working lightly by the contrarye, eſpecially when he hath any excellent thinge to worke to his own glory.</p>
            <p>After like ſorte may we eſteeme alſo of Martine Luther, who being firſte a frear, in what blindnes, ſuperſtition and darkenes, in what dreames and dregges of munkiſhe idolatrye he was drowned, his hiſtorie declareth, witnes recordeth, and this booke alſo partly doth ſpecifie. Whoſe religion was all in popiſh ceremonies, his zeale without knowledge, vnderſtanding no other iuſtification but in workes of the law and merites of his owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge, onely beleuing the hiſtorie (as many doe) of Chriſtes death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but not knowing the power and ſtrength thereof. After he had thus continued a longe ſpace, more phariſaicall and zealous in theſe monkiſh waies then the common ſorte of that order, at length it ſo pleaſed almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God to beginne with this man: firſt to touch his conſcience with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and feelinge of ſinne, his mind with feares and miſdoutes, whereby he was driuen to ſeeke further: So that by ſearching, ſeekinge, conferring, and by reading of S. Paule, ſome ſparckles of better knowledge beganne by litle and litle to appeare, which after in time grew vp to greater encreaſe. But here it happened to him as commonlye it doth to all good Chriſtians: The more that the true knowledge of Chriſte in him encreaſed, the more Sathan the enemy ſtirred with his fiery dartes, with doubtes and obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with falſe terrours and ſubtill aſſaultes, ſeeking by all meanes poſſible howe to oppreſſe the inward ſoule which would faine take his reſt in Chriſte. In theſe ſpirituall conflictes and inward wraſtlings, how greuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was encumbred, fighting againſt incredulitie, errour and deſperation, maruelous it is to conſider: In ſo much, that three dayes and three nightes together he lay vppon his bedde without meate, drinke or any fleepe, like a deade man (as ſome of him doe write) labouringe in ſoule and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite vppon a certaine place of S. Paule in the third chapiter to the Rom. which was: <hi>Ad oſtendendam iuſtitiam ſua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> that is, <hi>to ſhevv his iuſtice,</hi> thinking Chriſt to be ſent to no other end but to ſhewe forth Gods iuſtice as an executor of the law, till at length, being aunſwered and ſatiſfied by
<pb facs="tcp:9456:5"/>
the Lord touching the right meaninge of thoſe wordes, ſignifying the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God to be executed vppon his Sonne to ſaue vs from the ſtroke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he immediatly vppon the ſame ſtarted vp from his bedde, ſo confirmed in faith, as nothing afterward could appall him: Beſides other manifold and greeuous tentations (which I ſpeake not of) of all ſortes and kindes, except onely of auarice, with the which vice onely he was neuer once tempted nor touched, as of him is writen by them that were conuerſant with him.</p>
            <p>In this meane while, during theſe conflictes and exerciſes of M. Luther, which notwithſtanding did him no hurt, but rather turned to his more furtherance in ſpirituall knowledge, Pope Leo the .x. ſent a Iubiley with his pardons abroade through all Chriſtian realmes and dominions, wherby he gathered together innumerable riches and treaſure. The colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors wherof promiſed to euery one that would put ten ſhillinges in the box, licence to eate whitemeat and fleſh in lent, and power to deliuer what ſoule he woulde out of purgatorye, and moreouer full pardon from all his ſinnes, were they neuer ſo heynous. But if it were but one iote leſſe then .x. ſhillings, they preached that it would profite him nothing. The abomination wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was ſo horrible, that when no other man durſt ſpeake, yet Luther could not of conſcience holde his peace, but drawing out certaine articles, deſired gently to diſpute the matter, writing withall a moſt humble admonition to the Pope, ſubmitting him ſelfe in moſt lowely wiſe to his cenſure and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the Pope thinkinge great ſcorne to be controlled of ſuch a frear, tooke the matter ſo hoate, that he with all his Cardinals, with all the rable of Monkes and Frears, Biſhops and Archbiſhops, Colleges and vniuerſities, Kinges and Princes, with the Emperour alſo himſelfe, were all vppon him. If the omnipotent prouidence of the Lord from aboue had not ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, what was it for one poore frear to haue endured all theſe ſharpe aſſaultes of Sathan, all the violence of the whole world, hauinge no leſſe then the ſoone, the moone and ſeuen ſtarres (as they ſay) againſt him? being hated of men, impugned of deuilles, reiected of nations, by ſolemne authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty condemned, diſtreſſed with infirmities, and with all maner of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tried and proued. And yet for all theſe tentations ſuch was his life, that (as Eraſmus writing to Cardinall Wolſey affirmeth) none of all his enemies could euer charge him with any note of iuſt reprehenſion. Againe, ſuch were his allegations out of the ſcripture, that Roffenſis writing to Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, confeſſeth himſelfe to be aſtonied at them.</p>
            <p>And thus much by way of preface touching the conflictes and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of this man. Which we thought good to inſinuate to the Chriſtian reader for ſundry purpoſes: Firſt to note the mercifull clemencie of Chriſte
<pb facs="tcp:9456:5"/>
our Sauiour in calling ſo ſuperſtitious and idolatrous a frear ſo graciouſly to ſuch a light of his goſpell, his grace in iuſtifying him, his might in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him, his helpe in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting him, his glory in proſpering him, one againſt ſo many, and ſo proſpering him, that the whole kingedom of the Pope had no power either to withſtand him, or to maintaine it ſelfe: Secondly for this reſpect alſo and purpoſe, that the reader conſidering the meruelous working of the Lord in this man, may the better credite the doctrine which he teacheth. And though his doctrine as touching a litle circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſacrament can not be throughly defended, yet neither is that any greate maruell in him, who being occupied in weightier pointes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, had no leiſure to trauell in the ſearching out of this matter, neither ought it to be any preiudice to all the reſt which he taught ſo ſoundly of the weightier principles and groundes of Chriſtes Goſpell and our iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation onely by faith in Chriſt. And yet in the ſame matter of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not withſtanding that he altereth ſomewhat from Zuinglius, ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to nere to the letter: yet he ioyneth not ſo with the Papiſt,<note place="margin">Hereof reade more in the Apologie of the church of England, and in the booke of monuments fol. 992. Col. 2.</note> that he leaueth there any tranſubſtantiation or idolatrie. Wherefore the matter being no greater then ſo, nor directly againſt any article of our crede, let not vs be ſo nice, for one litle wart to caſt away the whole body. It were doutleſſe to be wiſhed, that in good teachers and preachers of Chriſt, there were no defect or imperfection. But he that can abide nothing with his blemiſh, let him, if he can, name any Doctor or writer (the ſcripture onely except) greke or latin, old or new, either beyond the Alpes or on this ſide the Alpes, or him ſelfe alſo, what ſo euer he be, which hath not erred in ſome ſentence or in ſome expoſition of holy ſcripture. But if he can not ſo doe, then let him learne by him ſelfe to beare with other, to take the beſt and leaue the worſt (although there is no ſuch matter in this booke to be feared, forasmuch as we hauing a reſpect to the ſimple haue purpoſely ſpu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out and omitted ſuch ſtumbling places, being but few, which might offend) and to geue God thankes for any thing that is good, and namely for this which he hath geuen to vs by Luther, in opening to vs his grace, mercy and good will in his Sonne ſo excellently through the preaching of this man: who if he had not taught the difference betwene the lawe and the goſpell, and ſet out to vs our iuſtification, victory and libertie by faith onely in Chriſt ſo plainely, ſo plentifully and ſo aſſuredly as he hath done, who euer durſt haue bene ſo bold to open his mouth in ſuch wordes, or ſo confidently to ſtand in this doctrine of faith and grace? For if there haue bene ſince the time of Luther, and be yet ſome, which openly defend that workes be neceſſary to ſaluation, where he before ſo mightely hath taught
<pb facs="tcp:9456:6"/>
the contrary: what then would theſe haue done if Luther had not bene? who alſo did forewarne vs of the ſame, propheſying that after his time this doctrine of iuſtification would be almoſt extinguiſhed in the church, as in certaine places experience beginneth partely to proue.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, ſo much as the Lord ſhall geue vs grace, let vs hold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the comfortable doctrine of faith and iuſtification, &amp; not loſe that the Lord ſo freely hath geuen, calling vppon the Lord with all obedience and diligence, to geue vs grace with S. Paule, not to refuſe the grace whiche he beſtoweth vppon vs, nor to be offended with this ioyfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as many be. And therefore as our duty was for our part to ſet it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, ſo our counſell is no leſſe to euery ſtudious reader thereof, to pray for grace, rightly to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that he readeth. For els, vnleſſe the ſpecial grace of Chriſt doe helpe, hard it is to fleſh and blood to comprehend this myſticall doctrine of faith onely. So ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge it is to carnall reaſon, ſo darke to the world, ſo many enemies it hath, that except the ſpirite of God from aboue doe reueale it, learning can not reach it, wiſedome is offended, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is aſtonied, deuilles doe not knowe it, men doe perſecute it. Briefely, as there is no way to life ſo eaſie, ſo is there none ſo hard: Eaſie to whom it is geuen from aboue: hard to the carnall ſenſe not yet enſpired. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce whereof is the roote of all errours, ſectes and diuiſions, not onely in all chriſtendome, but alſo in the whole world. The Iewe thinketh to be ſaued by his Moſes lawe, the Turke by his Alcoran, the philoſopher by his morall vertues. Beſides theſe, commeth an other ſort of people, not ſo ill as the Iewe, nor ſo hethen as the philoſopher, but hauing ſome part of both, which refuſe not vtterly the name of Chriſt, but with Chriſt doe ioyne partely the law of Moſes, partely the morall and naturall diſcipline of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and partely their owne ceremonies and traditions, to make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way to heauen. And theſe here in this commentary are called papiſts, of the Pope their author, being diuided within themſelues more then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an hundreth diuers ſectes, orders and profeſſions of Cardinales, Frears, Monkes, Nunnes, Prieſtes, Heremites, and other votaries. All which ſeeme to ſpringe vp of no other cauſe but onely vppon ignorance of this doctrine. And no meruell: For take away this doctrine of iuſtification by faith onely in Chriſt, and leaue a man to his owne inuentions, what ende will there be of newe deuiſes? Such a perilous thing is it to erre in the firſt fundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: whereuppon the higher ye build, the greater is the fall. And yet ſuch builders are not without their proppes to hold vppe their workemanſhip of workes againſt this doctrine of iuſtifying faith, pretending for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence the teſtimonie of S. Iames, where he ſeemeth to attribute iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:9456:6"/>
to workes and not to faith onely.</p>
            <p>Touching which matter of iuſtification, for as much as in the ſequele of this treatiſe the author hath diſcourſed vpon the ſame at large, it ſhall not be much needefull to vſe many wordes at this preſent. This briefely may ſuffice by way of preface, in a word or two to aduertiſe the chriſtian reader, who ſo taketh in hand with profite and iudgement to reade this booke, that in him two things are ſpecially to be required: Firſt to reade it wholy togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not by peeces and partes here and there, but to take it in order as it lyeth, conferring one place with an other, wherby to vnderſtand the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the right meaning of the writer, howe and in what ſenſe he excludeth good workes, and howe not: howe he neglecteth the law, and how he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the lawe. For, as in caſe of iuſtifying before God, the free promiſe of the goſpell admitteth no condition, but faith onely in Chriſt Ieſu: ſo in caſe of dutifull obedience, Luther here excludeth no good works, but rather ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>horteth thereunto, and that in many places. Thus times and caſes diſcret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt be diſtincted.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be required is, that in reading hereof, he that ſeketh to take frute hereby, doe bring ſuch a mind with him to the reading, as the author him ſelfe did to the preaching therof: that is, he had neede to haue his ſenſes exerciſed ſomewhat in ſuch ſpirituall conflictes, and to be well humbled before with the feare of God and inward repentance, or els he ſhal hardly conceaue the excellent ſwetenes either of this writer or any other. For albeit moſt true it is, that no greater comfort to the ſoule of man can be found in any booke next to the holy ſcripture, then in this commentary of M. Luther: ſo this comforte hath litle place, but onely where the conſcience being in heauines hath neede of the phiſicions hand. The other, who feele the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues whole &amp; are not touched in ſoule with any ſorowe, as they litle care for theſe bookes, ſo haue they litle vnderſtandinge of this doctrine when they reade it. And this is the cauſe in my mind, why the Pope &amp; his papiſtes haue ſo litle feeling &amp; liking of Luthers doctrine, and all becauſe they commonly are neuer greatly vexed in ſpirite with any deepe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather deride them that be beaten downe with ſuch conflictes and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations of Sathan, as they did by Luther, whom becauſe God ſuffered to to be tried and exerciſed with the buffets of the enemie, they ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he learned his diuinitie of the Deuill. But how he learned his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, let vs heare what he him ſelfe in this booke, fol. 197. &amp; 198. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth in theſe wordes, ſaying: <q>Vnleſſe we had be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exerciſed with viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and craftie aſſaultes by tirannes &amp; heretikes; and in our heart with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and fiery dartes of the deuill, Paule had bene to vs no leſſe obſcure,
<pb facs="tcp:9456:7"/>
then he was in times paſt to the whole world and yet is to this day to our aduerſaries the papiſtes, the Anabaptiſtes and other our aduerſaries: And therefore the gifte of knowledge of the ſcripture and our ſtudies through ſuch inward and outward conflictes, open vnto vs the minde of Paule and of all the Scriptures &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But let theſe ignorant papiſtes who ſo euer they be, taſt a litle the ſame or like as Luther did, and then ſee what they will ſay. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience geueth demonſtration. For howe many of them doe we ſee, for all their auricular confeſſion, which puffeth them vp in falſe ſecuritie, but at length, when they lie at the point of death, where death on the one ſide and Gods iuſtice on the other ſide is before their eies, for the moſt part ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they deſpaire, or ells leauing all other helpes, they onely ſticke to faith and the blood of Chriſt Ieſus, and in very deede many of them are glad to die Lutherans how ſo euer they hated Luther before. And what ſhall we ſay then of this doctrine of Luther? If the papiſtes them ſelues be glad to die in it, why are they vnwilling to liue in it? And if it be true at one time, how can alteration of time make that falſe which is once true?</p>
            <p>And therefore where theſe men ſo ſtoutely wihſtand this doctrine of iuſtification by faith onely, they are much deceaued. And where they alledge S. Iames for them, that is ſoone aunſwered if we rightly diſcerne the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of S. Iames and of S. Paule: Of whom the one ſpeaketh of mans righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes or iuſtification onely before men, which is a demonſtration of a true faith or a true beleuer before man, rather then the working of true iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before god. And ſo is it true which S. Iames ſaith, how that faith without workes doth not iuſtifie: whoſe purpoſe is, not to ſhewe vs what maketh a iuſt man before God, but onely to declare the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of good workes in him that by faith is iuſtified. The other ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of righteouſnes or iuſtification, not before men, but onely before God: meaning not to exclude good workes from true faith, that they ſhould not be done: but to teach vs wherin the true ſtay and hope of our ſaluation ought to be fixed, that is, in faith onely. And ſo is it true likewiſe that S. Paule ſaith, that faith onely without workes doth iuſtifie.</p>
            <p>The which propoſition of S. Paule the better to vnderſtand and to ioine it with S. Iames, here is to be noted for the ſatiſfying of the cauilling ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary, that the propoſition is to be taken full and whole, as S. Paule doth meane it, ſo that with the right ſubiect we ioyne the right predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, as the Scholemen terme it: that is, ſo that faith of Chriſt in iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, euer haue relation to the true penitent and lamenting ſinner. And ſo is the article moſt true, that faith onely without workes doth iuſtifie.
<pb facs="tcp:9456:7"/>
But whom doth it iuſtifie? the worldli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g? the licentious ruffen? the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Epicure? the carnall goſpeller? Paule meaneth no ſuch thing, but onely the mourning and labouring ſoule, the greeued conſcience, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting heart, the mending ſinner: And in him the propoſition is true, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine of S. Paule:<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Credenti in eu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> qui iuſtificat impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, fides eius imputatur ad iuſtitiam:</hi> that is, <hi>to him that beleueth in him vvhich iuſtifieth the vngodly, his faith is counted for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes.</hi> Contrarywiſe, let faith haue relation to the obſtinate and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rebel, who contrary to conſcience continueth and deliteth in ſinne, and in him it is true likewiſe that S. Iames ſaith: <hi>&amp; non ex fide tantum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iac. 2.</note> that is, <hi>and not by faith onely,</hi> meaning therby that faith auaileth not to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but onely in ſuch perſons as haue a good will and purpoſe to amend their liues: Not that repentance and turning from iniquitie doth ſaue them: but that faith in Chriſt worketh iuſtification in none but onely in ſuch as heartely repent and are willing to amend. So that:<note place="margin">Mar. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Credite E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelio, beleue the goſpell,</hi> hath euer: <hi>agite poenitentiam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> 
               <hi>repent and amend</hi> going withall. Not that repentance ſaueth any malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor from the law, but onely ſheweth the perſon whom faith in Chriſt onely doth ſaue and iuſtifie.</p>
            <p>But of this enough, and more then greatly needed, eſpecially ſeeing the booke it ſelfe here following will ſatiſfie the reader at large in all ſuch doutes to this matter appertaining. And thus ceaſing to trouble thee, gentle reader, with any longer preface, as we commend this good worke to thy godly ſtudies, ſo we commend both thee and thy ſtudies to the grace of Chriſt Ieſu the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely wiſhing and crauing of his maieſtie, that thou mayeſt take no leſſe profite and conſolation by reading hereof, then our purpoſe was to doe thee good in ſetting the ſame forth to thy comfort and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, which the Lord graunt, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Amen.</hi>

For in my heart this one article raigneth, euen the faith of Chriſt. From whom, by whom, and vnto whom all my diuine ſtudies day and night haue recourſe to and froe continually. And yet I perceaue that I coulde not reache any thing neare vnto the heighte, bredth, and depth of ſuche highe and ineſtimable wiſedome: onely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bare and poore beginnings, &amp; as it were fragments doe appeare. Wherfore I am aſhamed that my ſo barren and ſimple Comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries ſhould be ſet forthe vpon ſo worthy an Apoſtle, and elect veſſel of God. But when I conſider againe the infinite and horrible abuſes and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations which alwayes haue raged in the Churche of God, and yet at this day ceaſe not to rage againſt this onely and grounded rocke, which we holde to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> article of our iuſtification, (that is to ſay, howe, not by our ſelues, neither by our workes, which are leſſe then oure ſelues, but by an other helpe, euen the ſonne of God Ieſus Chriſt, we are redemed from ſinne, death, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuell, and made partakers of eternal life) I am compelled to caſt of all ſhame, &amp; to be bolde aboue meaſure.</p>

And this is the ſumme of the doctrine of the deuill and of the world from the beginning: We will not ſeeme to doe, euill, but yet whatſoeuer we doe that muſt God allow of, &amp; all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets muſt conſent to it, which if they ſhall refuſe to doe, they ſhall dye the death. <hi>Abell</hi> ſhall dye, but <hi>Cain</hi> ſhall floriſhe.

But they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme him a great deale leſſe then the Iewes doe, which at the leaſt thinke him to be <hi>Thola,</hi> that is to ſay, a theefe worthely hanged on the croſſe.

            <p>Becauſe therefore Chriſt is made as it were a mocke amongeſt his Chriſtians (for Chriſtians they wilbe called): and for that <hi>Cain</hi> doth kill <hi>Abell</hi> continually,<note place="margin">The argument of iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, very neceſſary and diligently to be handled.</note> &amp; the abhomination of Sathan doth now chefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raigne, it is very neceſſary that we ſhould diligently handle this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and ſet it againſt Sathan, whether we be rude or eloquent, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or vnlearned. For this rocke muſt be publiſhed abrode, yea though euery man ſhould holde his peace, yet euen of the very rockes &amp; ſtones them ſelues. Wherfore I doe moſt willingly heerein accompliſh my duetie, and am contented to ſuffer this long Commentarie and full of wordes, to be ſet forth for the ſtirring vp of all the brethren in Chriſt, againſt the ſleights and malice of Sathan, which in theſe dayes is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into ſuche extreame madneſſe againſt this healthfull knowledge of Chriſt now reuealed and raiſed vp againe: that as hetherto men haue ſeemed to be poſſeſſed with deuels and ſtarke madde, euen ſo nowe the deuils them ſelues doe ſeeme to be poſſeſſed of farre worſe deuels, and to rage euen aboue the furie of deuils,<note place="margin">The rage of Sathan, a ſure argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the day of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is at hande.</note> which is in deede a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that that enemie of truth and life, doth perceaue the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be at hand, which is the horrible day of his deſtruction, but the moſt comfortable day of our redemption, and ſhall be the end of all his tyrannie and crueltie.

            </p>
            <p>But I doe not ſet forth theſe my meditations ſo much againſt theſe men, as for my brethren, which will either ſhew them ſelues thankfull in the Lord for this my trauell, or els will pardon my weakenes and temeritie. But of the wicked I would not in any wiſe they ſhould be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked or allowed: but rather that therby both they and their God might be the more vexed, ſeeing with my greate trauell they are ſette forth onely for ſuche as <hi>S. Paule</hi> writeth this Epiſtle vnto: that is to ſay, the troubled,<note place="margin">For vvhoſe cauſe ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Luther ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth this vvorke and vvho they be that onely vnderſtand this doctrine.</note> afflicted, vexed, tempted, (for they onely vnderſtande theſe thinges) and miſerable <hi>Galathians</hi> in the Faithe. Who ſo are not ſuch, let them heare the papiſtes, monkes, anabaptiſtes and ſuch other maiſters of profound wiſdome and of their owne religion, and let them ſtoutly contemne our doctrine and our doinges. For at this day the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes and anabaptiſtes conſpire together againſt the church in this one point (though they diſſemble in wordes) that the worke of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon the worthines of the perſon. For thus do the Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes teach:<note place="margin">The dignitie of Gods vvord and the ſacraments depend not vpon the vvorthines or vnvvorthines of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> that baptiſme is nothing except the perſon doe beleeue. Out of this principle muſt needes follow, that all the workes of God be nothing if the man be nothing. But baptiſme is the worke of God, and yet notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding an euell man maketh it, not to be the worke of God. Moreouer, hereof it muſt follow that matrimonie, authoritie, libertie and bondage, are the workes of God: but becauſe men are euill, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not the workes of God. Wicked men haue the ſunne, the moone, the earth, the water, the aire, and all ſuche other creatures ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto them: but becauſe they be wicked and not godly, therfore the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9456:10"/>
ſunne is not the ſunne, the moone, the earth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water, are not that which they are. The Anabaptiſtes them ſelues had bodies and ſoules before they were rebaptiſed: but becauſe they were not godly, therefore they had not true bodies and true ſoules. Alſo their parentes were not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully married (as they graunt them ſelues) becauſe they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſed: therefore the Anabaptiſtes them ſelues are all baſtards, and their parentes were all adulterers and whoremongers, and yet they doe inherite their parents landes and goods, although they graunt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to be baſtardes and vnlawfull heires. Who ſeeth not here in the Anabaptiſtes, men not poſſeſſed with Deuills, but euen Deuills them ſelues poſſeſſed with worſe Deuills?</p>
            <p>The Papiſtes in like manner vntill this daie doe ſtande vpon wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and the worthines of man, contrary to grace, and ſo (in wordes at the leaſt) doe ſtrongly aſſiſt their brethren the Anabaptiſtes.

Paule</hi> goeth aboute to eſtabliſhe the Doctrine of Faith, grace, forgeueneſſe of ſinnes, or Chriſtian righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, to the ende that we may haue a perfecte knowledge and difference betweene Chriſtian righteouſneſſe, and all other kindes of righteouſneſſe. For there be diuers ſortes of rightuouſneſſe.<note place="margin">Hovve many kindes of righteouſnes there are.</note> There is a politicall or ciuile righteouſneſſe, which Emperours, Princes of the world, Philoſophers and Lawyers deale withall. There is alſo a Ceremoniall righteouſneſſe, which the traditions of men doe teach. This righteouſneſſe parentes and ſchoolemaiſters may teache with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daunger, becauſe they doe not attribute vnto it any vertue to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie for ſinne, to pleaſe God, or to deſerue grace: but they teache ſuche Ceremonies as are onely neceſſary for the correction of maners, and certaine obſeruations concerning this life. Beſides theſe, there is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther righteouſneſſe, which is called the righteouſneſſe of the lawe, or of the ten commaundements, which <hi>Moiſes</hi> teacheth. This doe we alſo teache after the doctrine of Faith.</p>
               <p>There is yet an other righteouſneſſe, which is aboue all theſe:<note place="margin">Chriſtian righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſnes.</note> to witte, the rightuouſneſſe of Faith, or Chriſtian rightuouſneſſe, the which we muſt diligently diſcerne from the other afore rehearſed: for they are quite contrary to this rightuouſneſſe, both becauſe they flowe out of the lawes of Emperours, the traditions of the Pope, and the commaundements of God, &amp; becauſe they conſiſt alſo in our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and may be wrought of vs either by our pure naturall ſtrength (as the Sophiſters terme it), or elſe by the gifte of God. For theſe kindes of rightuouſneſſe are alſo the gift of God, like as other good things are which we doe enioy.</p>
               <p>But this moſt excellent rightuouſneſſe, of Faith I meane, (which God through Chriſte, without workes imputeth vnto vs) is neither Politicall, nor Ceremoniall, nor the rightuouſneſſe of Gods lawe, nor

For in this we worke nothing, we render nothing vnto God: but onely we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue and ſuffer an other to worke in vs, that is to ſay, God. There <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e it ſeemeth good vnto me to call this righteouſnes of faith, or Chriſtian righteouſneſſe, the paſſiue righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>This is a righteouſnes hidden in a miſtery, which the world doth not know, yea Chriſtians them ſelues doe not throughly vnderſtand it, and can hardly take hold of it in their tentations. Therefore it muſt be diligently taught and continually practiſed. And who ſo doth not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand or apprehend this righteouſneſſe in afflictions and terrors of conſcience, muſt neades be ouerthrowne. For there is no comfort of conſcience ſo firme and ſo ſure as this paſſiue righteouſneſſe is.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The infirmitie of man in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note>But mannes weakenes and miſery is ſo great, that in the terrors of conſcience &amp; daunger of death, we behold nothing els but our workes, our worthines and the lawe: which when it ſheweth vnto vs our ſinne, by and by cure euill life paſt commeth to remembraunce. Then the poore ſinner with greate anguiſh of ſpirite groneth, and thus thinketh w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him ſelfe: Alas how deſperatly haue I liued? would to God I might liue longer: Then would I amend my life. Thus mans reaſon can not reſtraine it ſelfe from the ſight and beholding of this actiue or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king righteouſnes, that is to ſay, her owne righteouſnes: nor lift vp her eyes to the beholding of the paſſiue or chriſtian righteouſneſſe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth altogether in the actiue righteouſneſſe: So deepely is this euell rooted in vs.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, Sathan abuſing the infirmitie of oure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth encreaſe and aggrauate theſe cogitations in vs. Then can it not be but that the pore conſcience muſt be more greeuouſly troubled, confounded, and terrified. For it is vnpoſſible that the minde of man, of it ſelfe ſhould conceiue any comfort, or loke vp vnto grace onely, in the feeling and horror of ſinne, or conſtantly reiect all diſputing and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about works. For this is farre aboue mannes ſtrength and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, yea, and aboue the lawe of God alſo. True it is, that of all things in the world,<note place="margin">The lavve can not comfort vs in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> the law is moſt excellent: yet is it not able to quiet a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conſcience, but encreaſeth terrors, and driueth it to deſperation. <hi>For by the lavve, ſinne is made aboue meaſure ſinfull.</hi> Romaines the ſeuenth, and thirtene verſe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the afflicted and troubled conſcience hath no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt deſperation and eternall death, vnleſſe it take holde of the

forgeueneſſe of ſinnes by grace, freely offered in Chriſte Ieſus: that is to ſay, this paſſiue righteouſneſſe of Faith or Chriſtian righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Which if it can apprehend, then may it be at quiet, and boldly ſay: I ſeeke not this actiue or working righteouſneſſe: althoughe I knowe that I ought to haue it, and to fulfill it. But be it ſo that I had it, and did fulfill it in deede: yet notwithſtanding I can not truſt vnto it, neither dare I ſet it againſt the iudgment of God. Thus I abandone my ſelfe from al actiue righteouſneſſe, both of mine owne and of Gods law, and embrace onely that paſſiue righteouſneſſe, which is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of grace, mercy, and forgeuenes of ſinnes: briefly I reſt onely vpon that righteouſneſſe which is the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt and of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Like as the earth engendreth not raine, nor is able by her owne ſtrength, labor and trauell to procure the ſame, but receaueth it of the meere gift of God from aboue: ſo this heauenly righteouſneſſe is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs of God without our workes or deſeruinges. Looke then how much the earth of it ſelfe is able to doe in getting and procuring to it ſelfe ſeaſonable ſhowers of raine to make it fruteful: euen ſo much &amp; no more are we able to do by our owne ſtrength &amp; works in winning this heauenly &amp; eternall righteouſneſſe, &amp; therfore ſhall neuer be able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain vnto it, vnles God him ſelf by meere imputation &amp; by his vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gift doe beſtow it vpon vs. The greateſt knowledge then and the greateſt wiſedome of Chriſtians is, not to know the lawe, to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of workes and of the whole actiue righteouſneſſe, eſpecially when the conſcience wreſtleth with the iudgement of God. Like as on the contrary, amongſt thoſe which are not of the number of Gods people, the greateſt point of wiſedome is, to knowe and earneſtly to vrge the lawe and the actiue righteouſneſſe</p>
               <p>But it is a thing very ſtraunge and vnknowen to the world,<note place="margin">The lavve is not giuen to a righteous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but to the lavvleſſe and diſobedient. <hi>Tit. 1, 9 Rom. 3, 20.</hi>
                  </note> to teach Chriſtians to learne to be ignorant of the lawe, and ſo to liue before God, as if there were no law. For except thou be ignorant of the law, &amp; be aſſuredly perſwaded in thine hart that there is now no lawe nor wrath of God: but altogether grace and mercy for Chriſtes ſake, thou canſt not be ſaued: for by the law commeth the knowledge of ſinne. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, workes and the keeping of the law muſt be ſo ſtreitly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the world, as if there were no promiſe or grace: and that becauſe of the ſtubborne, proude, and hard harted, before whoſe eies nothing muſt be ſet but the lawe, that they may be terrified and humbled. For the law is geuen to terrifie and to kill ſuch, and to exerciſe the old man:
<pb facs="tcp:9456:13"/>
And both the word of grace and of wrath muſt be rightly diuided, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of the Apoſtle in the ſecond Epiſtle of Timothe, Chapter. <hi>2.</hi> verſe. <hi>15.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is then required a wiſe and a faithfull diſpoſer of the word of God, which can ſo moderate the lawe, that it may be kept within his boundes. He that teacheth that men are iuſtified before God by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the lawe, paſſeth the boundes of the lawe, and confoundeth theſe two kindes of righteouſneſſe, actiue and paſſiue, and is but an ill Logician, for he doth not rightly diuide. Contrariwiſe, he that ſetteth forth the lawe and workes to the old man, and the promiſe of forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſinnes and Gods mercy to the new man, diuideth the word wel. For the fleſh or the old man muſt be coupled with the lawe and works: the ſpirit or new man muſt be ioyned with the promiſe of God and his mercy. Wherefore, when I ſee a man that is bruſed enough already, oppreſſed with the lawe, terrified with ſinne, and thirſting for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, it is time that I ſhould remoue oute of his ſight the lawe and actiue righteouſnes, and that I ſhould ſet before him by the Goſpell the Chriſtian and paſſiue righteouſnes: which excluding <hi>Moſes</hi> with his lawe, offereth the promiſe made in Chriſt, who came for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and for ſinnes. Here is man raiſed vp againe, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth good hope: neither is he any longer vnder the lawe, but vnder grace. Howe not vnder the lawe? According to the newe man, to whom the law doth not pertaine. For the lawe hath his boundes but vnto Chriſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 6, 14. Rom. 10, 4. Galat. 3, 24</note> as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith afterwardes: The lawe continueth vnto Chriſt: who being come, <hi>Moſes</hi> ceaſeth with his lawe, Circumciſion, the Sacrifices, the Sabbothes, yea, and all the Prophetes.</p>
               <p>This is our diuinitie: wherby we teach how to put a difference betwene theſe two kindes of righteouſneſſe, actiue and paſſiue: to the end that maners and faith, workes and grace, policie and religion, ſhuld not be confounded or taken the one for the other. Both are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but both muſt be kept within their boundes. Chriſtian righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes pertaineth to the newe man, and the righteouſnes of the lawe pertaineth to the old man,<note place="margin">Po. 1, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wpon this old man, as vpon an aſſe, there muſt be laied a burthen that may preſſe him downe: and he muſt not enioy the freedome of the ſpirite or grace, except he firſt put vpon him the newe man by faith in Chriſt, (which notwithſtanding is not fully done in this life): then may he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the kingdome and ineſtimable gifte of grace.</p>
               <p>This I ſay to the end that no man ſhould thinke we reiecte or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid

They knowe nothing but the righteouſnes of the lawe, and yet they will iudge of that doctrine which is farre aboue the lawe: of which it is vnpoſſible that the carnall man ſhould be able to iudge. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt needes be offended: for they can ſee no higher then the lawe. What ſo euer then is aboue the lawe, is to them a greate offence. But we imagine, as it were two worldes: the one heauenly, and the other earthly. In theſe we place theſe two kindes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, being ſeparate the one farre from the other. The righteouſnes of the lawe is earthly and hathe to doe with earthly things, and by it we doe good workes. But as the earth bringeth not forthe frute except firſt it be watred and made frutefull from aboue: euen ſo by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of the lawe in doing many thinges we doe nothing, and in full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the lawe we fulfill it not, except firſt, without any merite or worke of ours, we be made righteous by the Chriſtian righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which nothing pertaineth to the righteouſneſſe of the lawe or to the earthly and actiue righteouſneſſe. But this righteouſneſſe is heauenly: which (as is ſaid) we haue not of our ſelues,<note place="margin">Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe not vvroughte by vs, but vvrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght in vs. <hi>1. Cor. 15.49.</hi>
                  </note> but receaue it from heauen: which we worke not, but which by grace is wrought in vs, and apprehended by faith: wherby we mounte vp aboue all lawes and workes. Wherfore like as we haue borne (as <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaith) the image of the earthly <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo let vs beare the image of the heauenly, which is the newe man in a new world, where is no lawe, no ſinne no remorſe of conſcience, no death, but perfecte ioy, righteouſneſſe, grace, peace, life, ſaluation and glory.</p>
               <p>Why? doe we then nothing? doe we worke nothing for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this righteouſnes? I aunſwere: nothing at all.<note place="margin">

Heb. 1, 3. 1. Cor. 1, 30. Heb. 4.15. Rom. 4, 15.</note> For this is perfect righteouſneſſe, to doe nothing, to heare nothing, to knowe nothing of the law, or of workes: but to know and to beleeue this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Chriſte is gone to the father, and is not nowe ſeene: that he ſitteth in heauen at the right hande of his Father, not as a iudge, but made vnto vs of God, wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, holineſſe and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Breefely, that he is our high Prieſt, intreating for vs, and raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ouer vs and in vs by grace. In this heauenly righteouſneſſe, ſinne can haue no place: for there is no lawe, and where no lawe is, there can be no tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p>Seing then that ſinne hath here no place, there can be no anguiſh of conſcience, no feare, no heauineſſe. Therfore <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">1. Io. 5, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>he that is

                  <hi>can not ſinne.</hi> But if there be any feare or greefe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it is a token that this righteouſnes is withdrawen, that grace is hidden and out of ſighte, and that Chriſt is darkened and not to be ſeene. But where Chriſt is truely ſeene is deede, there muſt needes be full and perfect ioy in the Lord, with peace of conſcience, which moſte certainly thus thinketh: Although I am a ſinner by the law, and vnder the condemnation of the lawe, yet I deſpaire not, yet I die not becauſe Chriſt liueth, who is bothe my rightuouſneſſe and my euerlaſting life. In that rightuouſneſſe and life I haue no ſinne, no feare, no ſting of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, no care of death. I am in dede a ſinner as touching this preſent life, and the righteouſneſſe therof, as the childe of <hi>Adam:</hi> where the law accuſeth me, death reigneth ouer me, and at length will deuoure me. But I haue an other righteouſneſſe and life aboue this life, which is Chriſt the ſonne of God, who knoweth no ſinne nor death, but is righteouſneſſe and life eternall: by whome, this my body being dead and brought into duſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. verſ. 19.20.21. &amp;c.</note> ſhalbe raiſed vp againe, and deliuered from the bondage of the lawe and ſinne, and ſhalbe ſanctified together with the ſpirite.</p>
               <p>So bothe theſe continue whileſt we heere liue. The fleſh is accuſed, exerciſed with temptations, oppreſſed with heauineſſe and ſorrowe, bruſed by this actiue righteouſneſſe of the law: but the ſpirit reigneth, reioyceth, and is ſaued by this paſſiue and chriſtian righteouſneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it knoweth that it hath a Lord in heauen at the right hand of his father, who hath aboliſhed the law, ſinne, death, and hath troden vnder his feete all euils, led them captiue, and triumphed ouer them in him ſelfe. <hi>Coloſſ. 2.15.</hi>

               <p>Therfore doe we ſo often repeate, and ſo earneſtly ſet forthe this doctrine of Faith or Chriſtian righteouſneſſe, that by this meanes it may be kept in continuall exerciſe, and may be plainly diſcerned from

the actiue righteouſneſſe of the law. Otherwiſe we ſhall neuer be able to holde the true diuinitie (for by this onely doctrine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Church is built, and in this it conſiſteth) but by &amp; by we ſhall either become Canoniſts, obſeruers of Ceremonies, obſeruers of the law, or papiſts,<note place="margin">See vvhat vve fal into, vvhen vve neglecte this doctrine, or vvant true zeale to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the ſame.</note> and Chriſt ſo darkened, that none in the Churche ſhall be either rightly taught or comforted.

And this diſtinction is eaſie to be vttered in wordes: but in vſe and experience it is very hard, althoughe it be neuer ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently exerciſed and practiſed, for that in the houre of death, or in other agonies of the conſcience, theſe two ſortes of righteouſneſſe do encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more nere together, then thou wouldeſt wiſhe or deſire. Wherfore I doe admoniſhe you, eſpecially ſuch as ſhall become inſtructers and guiders of conſciences, and alſo euery one apart, that ye exerciſe your ſelues continually by ſtudie, by reading, by meditation of the worde, and by prayer, that in the time of temptation ye may be able to inſtruct and comfort bothe your owne conſciences and others, and to bring them from the law to grace, from the actiue and working righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to the paſſiue and receiued righteouſneſſe: and to conclude, from <hi>Moiſes</hi> to Chriſt. For the deuill is wont in affliction, and in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flict of conſcience, by the law to make vs afraide, and to lay againſt vs the conſcience of ſinne, our wicked life paſt, the wrathe and iudgement of God, hell and eternall death, that by this meanes he may driue vs to deſperation, make vs bondſlaues to him ſelfe, &amp; plucke vs from Chriſt. Furthermore, he is wont to ſet againſt vs thoſe places of the goſpell, wherin Chriſt him ſelfe requireth workes of vs, &amp; with plaine wordes threatneth danmation to thoſe that doe them not. Nowe, if here we be not able to iudge betwene theſe two kinds of righteouſnes: if we take not hould of Chriſt by fayth ſitting at the right hand of God, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interceſſion vnto the father for vs miſerable ſinners,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.30. Heb. 7.25.</note> then are we vnder the lawe and not vnder grace, and Chriſt is no more a Sauiour but a lawe geuer: ſo that now there remaineth no more ſaluation, but certaine deſperation and euerlaſting death except repentance follow.</p>
               <p>Let vs then diligently learne to iudge betwene theſe two kindes of righteouſnes, that we may know how farre we ought to obey the law. Now, we haue ſayd before, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> law in a Chriſtian ought not to paſſe his bounds, but ought to haue dominion onely vpon the fleſh, which is in ſubiection vnto it &amp; remaineth vnder the ſame. When it is thus, the

lawe is kept within his bounds. But if it ſhall preſume to creepe into thy conſcience &amp; there ſeeke to raigne, ſee thou play the cunning Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and make true diuiſion. Geue no more to the lawe then is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: but ſay thou: O lawe, thou wouldeſt clime vp into the kingdome of my conſcience and there reigne and reproue it of ſinne, and wouldeſt take from me the ioy of my hart which I haue by faith in Chriſt, and driue me to deſperation, that I might be without all hope and vtterly periſh. This thou doeſt beſides thine office, keepe thy ſelfe within thy boundes, and exerciſe thy power vpon the fleſhe: but touch not my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>4.</hi> 15.</note> for I am baptiſed, &amp; by the goſpell am called to the pertaking of righteouſnes &amp; of euerlaſting life, to the kingdome of Chriſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my conſcience is at reſt, where no law is, but altogither forgeuenes of ſinnes, peace, quietnes, ioy, health and euerlaſting life. Trouble me not in theſe matters, for I will not ſuffer thee ſo intollerable a tyrante and cruell tormenter to reigne in my conſcience: for it is the ſeate and temple of Chriſt the ſonne of God,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>When I haue this righteouſnes reigning in my hart, I deſcend from heauen as the raine making frutefull the earth: that is to ſay, I come forth into an other kingdome, and I doe good workes how and whenſoeuer occaſion is offered.

If I be a magiſtrate, the charge that is geuen me from aboue I diligently execute. If I be a ſeruant, I doe my maſters buſines faithfully. To conclude, whoſoeuer he be that is aſſuredly perſuaded that Chriſt is his righteouſnes, he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chearefully and gladly worke well in his vocation, but alſo ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him ſelfe through loue to the magiſtrates and to their lawes, yea though they be ſeuere, ſharpe, and cruell, and (if neceſſitie doe ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) to all manner of burdens and daungers of this preſent life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth that this is the will of God, &amp; that this obedience is acceptable vnto him. Thus farre as concerning the argument of this Epiſtle, which <hi>S.

                  <p>For the goſpell is ſuch a doctrine as teacheth a farre higher mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then is the wiſedome, righteouſnes, and religion of the world: that is to ſay, free remiſſion of ſinnes through Chriſt. &amp;c.<note place="margin">The doctrine of the goſpell.</note> It leaueth theſe things in their degree, to be as they are, and commendeth them as the good creatures of God.

                  <p>We thought good to ſhewe heere by the way, that the goſpell is ſuch a doctrine as condemneth all manner of righteouſnes, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the onely righteouſnes of Chriſt, and to them that embrace the ſame, it bringeth peace of conſcience and all good thinges: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the world hateth and perſecuteth it moſt bitterly.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid that the occaſion why <hi>S. Paule</hi> wrote this Epiſtle, was for that by and by after his departure, falſe teachers had deſtroyed thoſe thinges among the Galathians, which he with long and greate trauel had builded.<note place="margin">The authority of the falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtels.</note> And theſe falſe Apoſtles being of the circumciſion &amp; ſecte of the Phariſeis, were men of great eſtimation and authoritie, which bragged among the people that they were of that holy &amp; choſen ſtock of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Io. 8. Rom. 4, 4.5.6.</note> that they were Iſraelites, of the ſeede of Abraham, that they had the promiſes and the fathers: and finally, that they were the miniſters of Chriſt and the Apoſtles ſchollers, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whom they had bene conuerſant &amp; had ſeene their miracles, and perhaps had alſo wrought ſome ſignes or miracles them ſelues:<note place="margin">Math. 7, ver. 22</note> For Chriſt witneſſeth that the wicked alſo doe worke miracles. Moreouer theſe falſe Apoſtles by all the crafty meanes they could deuiſe, defaced the authority of <hi>S. Paule,</hi> ſaying: Why doe ye ſo highly eſteeme of <hi>Paule?</hi> why haue ye him in ſo great reuerence? Forſoth he was but the laſt of all that were conuerted vnto Chriſt. But we are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſciples of the Apoſtles, &amp; were familiarly conuerſant w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them. We haue ſeene Chriſt working miracles &amp; heard him preache. <hi>Paule</hi> came after vs, and is inferior vnto vs: and it is not poſſible that God ſhould ſuffer vs to erre which are of his holy people, the miniſters of Chriſt, and haue receaued the holy Ghoſt. Again, we are many and <hi>Paule</hi> is but one and alone, who neither was conuerſant with the Apoſtles nor hath ſeene Chriſt: yea he perſecuted the church of Chriſt a great while. Would God, thinke ye, for <hi>Paules</hi> ſake onely, ſuffer ſo many churches to be deceaued?</p>
                  <p>When men hauing ſuch authoritie come into any countrey or citie, by and by the people haue them in greate admiration, and vnder this coulour of godlines &amp; religion, they doe not onely deceaue the ſimple,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9456:16"/>
but alſo the learned, yea and thoſe alſo which ſeeme to be ſomewhat confirmed in the faith: eſpecially when they bragge (as theſe did) that they are the ofſpring of the Patriarks, the miniſters of Chriſt, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſcollers &amp;c. Euen ſo the Pope at this day, when he hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the ſcripture to defend him ſelfe withal,<note place="margin">The argument of the papiſtes againſt vs.</note> vſeth this one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contenually againſt vs: <hi>The church, the church.</hi> Thinkeſt thou that God is ſo offended, that for a few heretikes of <hi>Luthers</hi> ſecte, he will caſt of his whole church? Thinkeſt thou that he would leaue his church in error ſo many hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth yeres? And this concluſion he chiefly ſtandeth vpon: that the church can not be ouerthrowne. Now like as many are moued with this argument at this day: ſo in <hi>Paules</hi> time theſe falſe Apoſtles through greate bragging and ſetting forth of their owne praiſes, blinded the eies of the <hi>Galathians:</hi> ſo that <hi>Paule</hi> loſt his authoritie among them, &amp; his doctrine was brought into ſuſpition.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this vaine bragging and boaſting of the falſe Apoſtles, <hi>Paule</hi> with greate conſtancie &amp; boldnes ſetteth his apoſtolical authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending his vocation &amp; defending his miniſtery.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie S.

And to abate their phariſaical pride and ſhameles boldnes, he maketh mention of the hiſtory done in <hi>Antiochia,</hi> where he w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtode <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Beſides this, not regarding the offence that might riſe therof, he ſaith plainly in the text, that he was bold to accuſe &amp; reproue eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> him ſelf the chiefe of the Apoſtles, who had ſeene Chriſt, and had bene moſt familiarly conuerſant with him. I am an Apoſtle (ſaith he) and ſuch a one as paſſe not what others are: yea, I was not afraid to chide the very piller of all the reſt of the Apoſtles. And to conclude, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt two chapters he doth in a manner,<note place="margin">The ſumme of the tvvo firſt chapters.</note> nothing els but ſette out his vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his office and his goſpell, affirming that it was not of men and that he had not receaued it by man, but by the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt: Alſo, that if he,<note place="margin">Galat. 5.</note> yea or an Angell from heauen ſhould bring any other goſpel then that which he had preached, he ſhould be holden accurſed.</p>

                     <head>The certaintie of calling.</head>
                     <p>But what meaneth <hi>Paule</hi> by this his boaſting? I aunſwere: This common place ſerueth to this end,<note place="margin">The miniſter of God muſt be ſure of his calling.</note> that euery miniſter of Gods word ſhould be ſure of his calling, that before God and man he may with a bold conſcience glory herein that he preacheth the goſpell as one that
<pb facs="tcp:9456:17"/>
is called and ſent: Euen as the Embaſſadour of a King glorieth and vaunteth in this, that he commeth not as a priuate perſon, but as the Kings Embaſſadour, and becauſe of this dignitie that he is the Kings Embaſſadour, he is honored and ſet in the higheſt place. Which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhould not be geuen vnto him, if he came as a priuate perſon. Wherefore let the preacher of the goſpell be certaine that his calling is from God. And it is expedient that according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of <hi>Paule</hi> he ſhould magnifie this his calling, to the end that he may winne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and authoritie among the people, like as the Kings Embaſſadour magnifieth his office and calling. And thus to glory, is not a vain but a neceſſary kinde of glorying, becauſe he glorieth not in him ſelfe but in the King which hath ſent him: whoſe authoritie he deſireth to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and magnified.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe when <hi>Paule</hi> ſo highly commendeth his calling, he ſeeketh not his owne praiſe,<note place="margin">The glorying of S. Paule ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly.</note> but with a neceſſary and holy pride he magnifieth his miniſtery: As to the <hi>Rom. 11.</hi> he ſayth: For as much as I am the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> I will magnifie mine office: that is to ſay, I will that men receaue me,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.13.</note> not as <hi>Paule of Tharſus,</hi> but as <hi>Paule</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle or Embaſſadour of Ieſus Chriſt. And this he doth of neceſſitie, to maintaine his authoritie, that the people in hearing this, might be more attent and willing to geue eare vnto him. For they heare not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Paule,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Preachers are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued as meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers from God, by vvhoſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie God himſelfe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</note> but in <hi>Paule,</hi> Chriſt himſelfe, and God the father ſending him out in his meſſage: whoſe authoritie and maieſtie, like as men ought religiouſly to honour, ſo ought they with greate reuerence to receaue and to heare his meſſengers bringing his word and meſſage.</p>
                     <p>This is a notable place therefore: wherein <hi>Paule</hi> ſo glorieth and boaſteth as touching his vocation, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he deſpiſeth all others.

But this maner of boaſting is neceſſary, and pertaineth not to the glory of <hi>Paule,</hi> but to the glory of God: whereby is offered vnto him the ſacrifice of praiſe and thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuing. For by this boaſting, the name, the grace &amp; the mercy of God is made knowne vnto the world. Thus then he beginneth this Epiſtle.</p>

                  <p>Here in the very beginning he toucheth thoſe falſe teachers, which boaſted them ſelues to be the diſciples of the Apoſtles, and to be ſent of them: but deſpiſed <hi>Paule</hi> as one that was neither the Apoſtles ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9456:17"/>
nor ſent of any to preach the goſpell, but came in ſome other way, and of his owne head thruſt him ſelfe into that office. Againſt thoſe <hi>Paule</hi> defendeth his calling, ſaying: My calling ſeemeth baſe to your preachers. But whoſoeuer they be which haue come vnto you, are ſent either of men or by man: that is to ſay, they haue entred either of them ſelues being not called, or els called by others. But my calling is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of men nor by man, but it is aboue all maner of calling that can be done by the Apoſtles, for it is by Ieſus Chriſt and by God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Where he ſaith <hi>of men,</hi> I meane ſuch as cal &amp; thruſt in themſelues when neither God nor man calleth nor ſendeth them, but they runne &amp; ſpeake of them ſelues. As at this day certaine fantaſtical ſpirits, which either creepe in corners and ſeeke places where they may powre out their poyſon, and come not into publike congregations: or els they go thither, wher the goſpel is pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted already. Theſe I cal ſuch as are ſent of men. But where he ſaith, <hi>by man,</hi> vnderſtand ſuch as haue a diuine calling, but yet by man as by meanes. God calleth then two maner of wayes: by meanes and without meanes. He calleth vs to the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his worde at this day, not immediatly by him ſelfe but by other meanes, that is to ſay, by man. But the Apoſtles were called immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly of Chriſt him ſelfe, as the Prophets in the old time were called of God himſelfe. Therefore when <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith: <hi>Not of men, neither by man,</hi> he beateth downe the falſe Apoſtles. As though he would ſay: Albeit thoſe vipers bragge neuer ſo much, what can they bragge more then that they are either come <hi>from men,</hi> that is to ſay, of them ſelues with out any calling, or, <hi>by man,</hi> that is to ſay: ſent of others. I paſſe not vpon any of theſe things, neither ought you to regard them.</p>
                  <p>As for me, I am called and ſent, neither of men, nor by man, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meanes, that is to witte, by Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe, and my calling is like in all points to the calling of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">The calling of the Apoſtles.</note> and I am in deede an Apoſtle. <hi>Paule</hi> therefore handleth this place of the calling of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles effectually. And elſwher he ſeperateth the degree of Apoſtleſhip from others, as in the firſt to the <hi>Corinth cap. 12.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.28. Epheſ. 4.11.</note> and in the fourth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where he ſaith: <hi>And God hath ordained ſome in the Churche, as firſt Apoſtles, ſecondly Prophets, thirdly teachers,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſetting Apoſtles in the firſt place: ſo that they be properly called Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles which are ſent immediatly of God him ſelfe without any other ordinary meanes.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Mathias</hi> was called onely of God. For when the other
<pb facs="tcp:9456:18"/>
Apoſtles had appoynted two,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Actes. 1.24.25.</hi> The calling of Mathias.</note> they durſt not chooſe the one nor the other, but they caſt lots, &amp; prayed that God would ſhew which of them he would haue. For ſeing he ſhould be an Apoſtle, it behoued that he ſhould be called of God.<note place="margin">Actes. 9.15.</note> So was <hi>Paule</hi> called to be the Apoſtle of the Gentiles.<note place="margin">The Apoſtles ſainctes.</note> Hereof the Apoſtles alſo are called Sainctes. For they are ſure of their calling and doctrine, and haue continued faithfull in their office,<note place="margin">Math. 27 5.</note> and none of them became a caſt away ſaue <hi>Iudas,</hi> becauſe theyr calling is holy.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt aſſault y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paule</hi> maketh againſt the falſe Apoſtles, which ranne when no man ſent them. Calling therfore is not to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed. For it is not enough for a man to haue the word &amp; pure doctrine, but alſo he muſt be aſſured of his calling, and he that entreth without this certaintie,<note place="margin">They vvhich be not called, do kil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy.</note> entreth to no other ende but to kill and to deſtroy. For God neuer proſpereth the labour of thoſe that are not called. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they teach ſome good and profitable matters withall, yet they edifie not.<note place="margin">The certaintie of calling.</note> So our fantaſticall ſpirites at this day haue the wordes of Faith in their mouthes, but yet they yeelde no frute, but their cheefe ende and purpoſe is to draw men to their falſe and peruerſe opinions. They that haue a certaine and holy calling, muſt ſuſtaine many and great conflictes: as they muſt do whoſe doctrine is pure and ſound, that they may conſtantly abide in their lawfull calling, againſt the infinite and continuall aſſaultes of the Deuill and rage of the world. Heere, what ſhould he doe whoſe calling is vncertaine and doctrine cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte?</p>
                  <p>This is then our comforte which are in the Miniſterie of the worde, that we haue an office which is heauenly and holy, to the which we being lawfully called, doe triumph againſt all the gates of hel. On the other ſide it is an horrible thing when the conſcience ſaith: This thou haſt done without any lawfull calling.<note place="margin">VVhat daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they be in vvhich haue no lavvfull calling.</note> Herein ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſhaketh a mans minde which is not called, that he would wiſh he had neuer heard the word which he teacheth. For by his diſobedience he maketh all his workes euill, were they neuer ſo good, in ſo much that euen his greateſt workes and labours become his greateſte ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then how good and neceſſary this boaſting and glorying of our miniſterie is. In times paſt when I was a yong deuine and teacher, me thought <hi>Paule</hi> did vnwiſely in glorying ſo oft of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in all his Epiſtles: but I did not vnderſtand his purpoſe. For I knew not that the miniſterie of Gods word was ſo waightie a matter.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9456:18"/>
I knew nothing of the doctrine of faith, and a true conſcience in deede,<note place="margin">VVhy Paule exalteth his calling ſo in euery place.</note> for that there was then no certaintie taught either in the Schooles or Churches, but al was ful of Sophiſtical ſubtilties of the Schooleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore no man was able to vnderſtand the dignitie and power of this holy and ſpirituall boaſting of the true &amp; lawfull calling, which ſerueth firſt to the glory of God, and ſecondly to the aduauncing of our office, and moreouer to the ſaluation of our ſelues, and of the people.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ierome</hi> moueth here a greate queſtion, why <hi>Paule</hi> calleth thoſe churches, which were no churches. Is it (ſaith he) becauſe <hi>Paule</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the <hi>Galathians</hi> that were peruerted and turned backe from Chriſt and from grace, vnto <hi>Moiſes</hi> and the law? Herevnto I anſwer, that <hi>Paule</hi> calleth them the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> by putting a part for the whole, which is a common thing in the ſcriptures. For writing in like maner to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he reioyſeth on their behalfe, that the grace of God was geuen them in Chriſt, namely, that they were made rich thorow him in all vtterance and knowledge: and yet many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were miſled by falſe Apoſtles, and beleeued not the reſurrection of the deade.</p>
                  <p>Allbeit then that the <hi>Galathians</hi> were fallen away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of <hi>Paule,</hi> yet did baptiſme, the worde, and the name of Chriſt remaine among them. There were alſo ſome good men that were not reuolted, which had a good opinion of the word and ſacraments, and vſed them rightly. Moreouer theſe things could not be defiled through them that were reuolted. For baptiſme, the goſpell, &amp; other things are not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made vnholy becauſe many are polluted and vnholy,<note place="margin">The vvord &amp; ſacramentes are not pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines.</note> and haue an euil opinion of them: but they abide holy, and the ſame that they were, whether they be among the godly or the vngodly: by whom they can neither be polluted, nor made holy. By our good or euil conuerſation, by our good or euill life and maners they be polluted or made holy in the ſight of the heathen, but not afore God. Wherefore whereſoeuer the ſubſtance of the word and ſacraments remaineth, there is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Church, although Antichriſt there reigne, who (as the ſcripture witneſſeth, (ſitteth not in a ſtable of Feends, or in a Swineſtie,<note place="margin">The ſeat of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt.</note> or in a company of Infidels, but in the higheſt and holieſt place of all, namely in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temple of God.

Much leſſe is ſinne taken away by the workes and inuentions of men, as wicked worſhippings, ſtraung religious, vowes and pilgrimages. Finally there is no worke that can take away ſinne: but ſinne is rather encreaſed by works.

The words are eaſy: but in tentation it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thing that can be, to be certainly perſwaded in our harts that by grace alone, without any other meanes either in heauen or earth, we haue remiſſion of ſinnes and peace with God.</p>
                  <p>The world vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not this doctrine, &amp; therfore it neither will nor can abide it,<note place="margin">The vvorld knovveth not the doctrine of true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> but condemneth it as hereticall and wicked.

                     <p>As for example, the Monke imagineth thus: Theſe works which I doe, pleaſe God. God will regard theſe my vowes, and for them will ſaue me. The Turke ſaith: If I keepe the things that are

This were by no meanes lawfull for him to doe, nay it were ſacrilege thus to doe, except he were very God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaying: <hi>I vvill not geue my glory vnto any other.</hi>

                     <p>And in that Chriſt geueth Grace and Peace, he geueth it not as the Apoſtles gaue and brought the ſame vnto men by preaching of the goſpell: but he geueth it as the author and creator.

Now, to geue Grace, Peace,<note place="margin">Hovve Chriſt giueth grace and peace.</note> euerlaſting life, to forgeue ſinnes, to make righteous, to quicken, to deliuer from death and the deuill, are not the workes of any creature, but of the diuine Maieſtie alone. The Angels can neither create nor geue theſe things.

                     <p>Many ſuch arguments are in <hi>Iohn,</hi> where it is proued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the workes which are attributed to the ſonne as well as to the father, that the diuinitie of the father and of the ſonne is all one.<note place="margin">One and the ſelf ſame God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the father and of the ſonne.</note> Therfore the giftes which we receiue of the father, and which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of the ſonne are all one.

But in knitting them both together, he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth them equally, as well to the ſonne as to the father. I do therfore ſo diligently admoniſh you of this thing, becauſe it is daungerous leſt among ſo many errours, and in ſo great varietie and confuſion of ſectes, there might ſtep vp ſome <hi>Arrians, Eunomians, Macedonians,</hi> and ſuch other heretikes, that might doe harme to the Churches with their ſubteltie.</p>

                  <p>But how may we obtaine remiſſion of our ſinnes? <hi>Paule</hi> anſwereth, that the man which is called Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelfe for them.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9456:24"/>
all the religions of the heathen, all works, all merits and all ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ceremonies. For if our ſinnes may be taken away by our owne works, merites and ſatiſfactions, what needed the ſonne of God to be giuen for them? But ſeeing he was giuen for them, it followeth, that we can not doe them away by our owne works.</p>
                  <p>Againe, by this ſentence it is declared, that our ſinnes are ſo great, ſo infinite and inuincible, that it is impoſſible for the whole world to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie for one of them: and ſurely the greatnes of the raunſome (namely Chriſt the ſonne of God, who gaue himſelfe for our ſinnes) declareth ſufficiently, that we can neither ſatiſfie for ſinne, nor haue dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it.

He that conſidereth theſe things well, vnderſtandeth that this one word <hi>Sinne,</hi> comprehendeth Gods euerlaſting wrath, &amp; the whole kingdome of Sathan, and that it is a thing more horrible then can be expreſſed: which oughte to moue vs, and make vs affraide in deede.

In deede Chriſt is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the law, but that is not his proper and principall office.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, as touching the words, we know wel enough and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> talke of them: but in practiſe and in the conflict, when the deuill goeth about to deface Chriſt, &amp; to plucke the word of grace out of our hartes, we finde that we doe not yet know them well and as we ſhould doe.

But this to doe in the conflict, is of all things the moſt hardeſt. I ſpeake this by experience: for I know the Deuils ſubtilties, who at that time not onely goeth about to feare vs with the terrour of the lawe, yea and alſo of a little mote maketh many beames, that is to ſay, of that which is no ſinne he maketh a very hell (for he is maruelous craftie both in aggrauating ſinne, and in puffing vp the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience euen in good works): but alſo is wont to feare vs with the very perſon of the Mediatour: into the which he tranſformeth him ſelfe, and laying before vs ſome place of the ſcripture or ſome ſaying of Chriſt, ſuddenly he ſtriketh our harts, and ſheweth him ſelfe vnto vs in ſuch ſort as if he were Chriſt in deede, leauing vs ſticking ſo faſt in that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our conſcience would ſweare it were the ſame Chriſt whoſe ſaying he alledged.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9456:27"/>
that is in the 13. of Luke: <hi>Except ye repent ye shall all likevviſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish:</hi> And ſo corrupting the true definition of Chriſt with his poiſon, he bringeth to paſſe that albeit we beleue him to be Chriſt the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, yet in very deede our troubled conſcience feeleth and iudgeth him to be a tiraunt and a iudge. Thus we being deceaued by Sathan, doe eaſily loſe that ſweete ſight of our high Prieſt and ſauiour Chriſt: which being once loſt, we ſhunne him no leſſe then the deuill him ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>And this is the cauſe why I doe ſo earneſtly call vpon you, to learne the true and proper definition of Chriſt out of theſe words of <hi>Paule: vvhich gaue him ſelfe for our ſinnes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This ſentence is diligently to be vrged: vvhich gaue him ſelfe for vs.</note> If he gaue him ſelfe to death for oure ſinnes, then vndoubtedly he is no tiraunt or iudge, which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs for our ſinnes: He is no caſter downe of the afflicted, but a raiſer vp of thoſe that are fallen, a mercifull releuer and comforter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauy and broken harted.

                  <p>By theſe wordes then: <hi>That he might deliuer vs &amp;c. Paule</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is the argument of this Epiſtle: to wit, that we haue neede of grace and of Chriſt, and that no other creature,<note place="margin">Chriſt only deliuereth vs out of this preſent euell vvorld.</note> neither man nor Angell, can deliuer man out of this preſent euill world. For theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes are onely belonging to the diuine Maieſtie, and are not in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of any, either man or Angell, that Chriſt hath put away ſinne, and hath deliuered vs from the tyrannie and kingdom of the Deuill, that is to ſay, from this wicked world, which is an obedient ſeruaunt, and a willing follower of the Deuill his God. Whatſoeuer that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer and father of lies either doth or ſpeaketh, that the world,<note place="margin">The vvorld obayeth his prince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</note> as his moſt loyall and obedient ſonne, diligently followeth and performeth. And therfore it is full of the ignoraunce of God, of hatred, lying, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, blaſphemie, and of the contempt of God: Moreouer of groſſe ſinnes, murthers, adulteries, fornications, theftes, robberies,<note place="margin">VVhat ſinnes are in the vvorld.</note> and ſuch like, becauſe he followeth his father the deuill, who is a lier and a murtherer. And the more wiſe, righteous and holy men are without Chriſt, ſo much the more hurt they doe to the goſpell. So we alſo that were religious men, were double wicked in the Papacie, before God did lighten vs with the knowledge of his goſpell, and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnder the colour of true pietie and holines.</p>
                  <p>Let theſe words then of <hi>Paule</hi> ſtand as they are in deede, true and effectual, not coloured or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfait, namely:<note place="margin">VVhat the vvorld is vvith all his vertues and righteouſnes.</note> that this preſent world is euill. Let it nothing at all moue thee that in a great nombre of men there be many excellent vertues, and that there is ſo great a ſhew of holines in hypocrites. But marke thou rather what <hi>Paule</hi> ſayeth: out of whoſe wordes thou maiſt boldly and freely pronounce this ſentence againſt the world: That the world with all his wiſedome, power, and righteouſnes is the kingdom of the deuill, out of the which God onely is able to deliuer vs by his onely begotten ſonne.</p>
                  <p>Therfore let vs praiſe God the father, &amp; geue him harty thankes for this his vnmeaſurable mercy, that hath deliuered vs out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Deuill, (in which we were holden captiues) by his owne ſonne, when it was impoſſible to be done by oure own ſtrength. And let vs acknowledge together with <hi>Paule,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> that all our works &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes (with all which we could not make the deuil to ſtoupe one hear
<pb facs="tcp:9456:29"/>
bredth) are but loſſe and dung. Alſo let vs caſt vnder our feete and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhorre all the power of free will, all Pharaſaicall wiſedom and righteouſnes, all religious orders, all Maſſes, ceremonies, vowes, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings,<note place="margin">Eſay. 64.6.</note> and ſuch like, as a moſt <hi>filthie defiled cloth,</hi> and as the moſt daungerous poyſon of the Deuill. Contrariwiſe let vs extoll and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the glory of Chriſt, who hath deliuered vs by his death, not out of a world onely, but out of an euill world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> then by this word <hi>Euill,</hi> ſheweth that the kingdom of the world, or the Deuils kingdom is a kingdom of iniquitie, ignoraunce, errour,<note place="margin">The kingdom of the vvorld.</note> ſinne, death, blaſphemie, deſperation and euerlaſting damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

hereafter in the 6 chapiter, where he ſaith: <hi>Brethern if a man be falne by occaſion into any fault, ye vvhich are ſpirituall reſtore ſuch a one vvith the ſpirite of meekenes, conſidering thy ſelfe, leſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> This example muſt we alſo follow, that we may ſhew our ſelues to beare like affection towards ſuch as are miſled, as parents beare towards their children, that they may perceaue our fatherly and motherly affection towards them, and may ſee that we ſeeke not their deſtruction but their welfare.

In deede they haue laid a foundation, that is to ſay, they haue well taught faith in Chriſt, but the beginning, midle, and end muſt be ioyned together.

Foraſmuch therefore as he could preuaile nothing that way, he ſtirreth vp wicked ſpirits and vngodly teachers, which at the firſt allow our doctrine, and teach the ſame with a common conſent together with vs. But afterwards they ſay, that it is our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to teach the firſt principles of Chriſtian doctrine, and that the very myſteries of the ſcriptures are reueiled vnto them from aboue by God himſelfe, and that they are called for this purpoſe, that they ſhould open them to the world.

                  <p>Marke here diligently,<note place="margin">Euery one that teacheth vvorkes, is a troubler of mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</note> that euery teacher of workes and of the righteouſnes of the law, is a troubler of the Church, and of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men.

Yea verely they be yet farre worſe then were thoſe falſe Apoſtles.

But the more holy that the heretikes ſeeme to be in outward ſhew, ſo much the more miſcheefe they doe.

                  <p>Nowe, the cauſe why he inueyeth ſo ſharply againſt them, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them the troublers of the Churches, is, for that beſides Faith in Chriſt, they taught that Circumciſion and the keeping of the law was neceſſary to ſaluation.

                     <pb facs="tcp:9456:35"/>Wherfore the falſe Apoſtles moſt earneſtly and obſtinately conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the law ought to be obſerued.

theſe two things the Deuill practiſeth moſt buſily.

                  <p>But becauſe they mingle the law and the Goſpell together, they can not but be the peruerters of the Goſpell. For either Chriſt muſt remaine and the law periſh: or the law muſt remaine and Chriſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: For Chriſt and the law can by no meanes agree and raigne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the conſcience. Where the righteouſnes of the law ruleth, there can not the righteouſnes of grace rule. And againe, where the righteouſnes of grace raigneth, there can not the righteouſnes of the lawe raigne: for one of them muſt needes geue place vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p>Wherefore the doctrine of Grace can by no meanes ſtande with the Doctrine of the Lawe.

And yet if it come to debating, the greater parte ouercommeth the better. For Chriſt with his ſide is weake, and the Goſpell is but a fooliſh preaching.

                     <hi>The vvorld can not hate you, but me it hateth, becauſe I teſtifie of it that the vvorkes thereof are euill.</hi> And in the third of Iohn: <hi>This is condemnation, that light is come into the vvorld, and men loued darknes more then light, becauſe rheir vvorkes vvere euill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe, that I teach the things which are of God (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) hereby it may ſufficiently appeare, that I preach the grace, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; glory of God alone. Moreouer, he that ſpeaketh (as Chriſt ſaith) thoſe things which his Lord and maiſter hath commaunded him, and glorifieth not him ſelfe, but him whoſe meſſenger he is, bringeth and teacheth the true woorde of God. But I teache thoſe things onely which are commaunded me from aboue: neither glorifie I my ſelfe, but him that ſent me.<note place="margin">Signes that teſtifie Paules doctrine to be true.</note> Beſides that, I ſtirre vp againſt my ſelfe the wrath and indignation both of the Iewes and Gentiles: Therefore my doctrine is true, pure, certaine and of God, neither can there be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (much leſſe then, any better) then this my doctrine is.

                  <p>So at this day you may finde many which labour to pleaſe men,<note place="margin">Teachers of mens traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe pleaſe men.</note> &amp; to the end they may liue in peace and ſecuritie of the fleſh, they teach mans doctrine, that is to ſay, wicked things, or els they allow the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies and wicked iudgements of the aduerſaries, contrary to the word of God and againſt their owne conſcience, that they may keepe ſtil the fauour of Princes and Biſhops, and enioy their goods: But we, becauſe we endeuour to pleaſe God and not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">The revvard of godly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> do ſtirre vp againſt vs the malice of the Deuill and of hell it ſelfe: we beare the reproches and ſclaunders of the world, death, &amp; al the miſchiefes that can be wrought againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>So ſaith <hi>Paule</hi> here: I ſeeke not to pleaſe men, that they may praiſe my doctrine, and report me to be an excellent teacher, but I deſire only that my doctrine may pleaſe God: and by this meanes I make men my mortal enemies. Which thing I find by experience to be moſt true: for they requite me with infamy, ſclaunder, impriſonment and ſword. Contrariwiſe, the falſe Apoſtles teach the things that are of men, that is to ſay, ſuch things as be pleaſant and plauſible to mans reaſon, and that to the end they may liue in eaſe and purchaſe the fauour, good will and praiſe of the people. And ſuch men finde that they ſeeke for.<note place="margin">The revvard of falſe and vngodly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. <hi>Mat. 6.2.</hi>

So haue all the Doctours of the primatiue Church,<note place="margin">The Deuils argument.</note> holy men, more auncient and better learned then thou.

                  <p>When I firſt tooke vpon me the defence of the Goſpell, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Doctor <hi>Staupitius</hi> a worthy man,<note place="margin">Doctour Stau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius a fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of Luthers doctrine, vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he began to preach.</note> ſayd thus vnto me. This liketh me well that this doctrine which thou preacheſt, yeldeth glory and all things elſe vnto God alone, and nothing vnto man: for vnto God there can not be attributed too much glory, goodnes, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. &amp;c. This ſaying did then greatly comfort and confirme me. And true it is that the doctrine of the Goſpell taketh from men all glory,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the goſpell attributeth all things vnto God, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to man.</note> wiſedom, righteouſnes. &amp;c. and geueth them to the creatour alone, who made all things of nothing. We may alſo more ſafely attribute too much vnto God then to man. For in this caſe I may ſay boldly: Be it ſo that the Church, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and other Doctours, alſo <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Apollo:</hi> yea euen an Angell from heauen, teach a contrary doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, yet my doctrine is ſuch, that it ſetteth forth and preacheth the grace and glory of God alone, and in the matter of ſaluation, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the righteouſnes and wiſedom of all men. In this caſe I can not offend, becauſe I geue both to God and man, that which properly and truely belongeth vnto them both.</p>
                  <p>But thou wilt ſay: <hi>The Church is holy, The Fathers are holy.</hi> It is true: notwithſtanding, albeit the church be holy, yet is it compelled to pray:<note place="margin">Mat. 1.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>forgeue vs our treſpaſſes.</hi> So, though the fathers be holy, yet are they ſaued through the forgeuenes of ſinnes.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9456:41"/>
This was therefore a ſtrong argument, and concluded mightely. For no man ſayth willingly that the Church erreth, and yet it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſay that it erreth, if it teache any thing beſides or againſt Gods worde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> the cheefe of the Apoſtles taught both in life and doctrine beſides Gods word, therfore he erred and was deceaued.<note place="margin">The errour of Peter.</note> Neither did <hi>Paule</hi> diſſemble that errour (although it ſeemed to be but a light fault) becauſe he ſawe it would turne to the hurt of the whole Church, but <hi>vvithſtoode him euen to his face,</hi>

Therefore neither is <hi>Peter</hi> my maſter, nor yet <hi>Iames.</hi> And as for the other Apoſtles, he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denieth that he ſaw any of them.</p>
                  <p>But why doth <hi>Paule</hi> repete this ſo often, that he learned not his goſpell of men,<note place="margin">VVhy Paule glorieth ſo much that he hath not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his goſpel of any man.</note> nor of the Apoſtles them ſelues? His purpoſe is this, to perſwade the churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> which were now led away by the falſe Apoſtles, and to put them out of all dout that his goſpell was the true word of God, and for this cauſe he repeteth it ſo often. And if he had not preuailed herein, he could neuer haue ſtopped the mouthes of the falſe apoſtles. For thus they would haue obiected agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt him: We are as good as <hi>Paule:</hi> we are the diſciples of the Apoſtles as well as he: Moreouer, he is but one alone and we are many, therfore we excell him, both in authoritie and in number alſo.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Paule</hi> was conſtrained to boaſt, to affirme, and ſweare, that he learned not his goſpell of any man, neither receaued it of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelues. For his miniſterie was here in great daunger, and al the churches likewiſe which had vſed him as their cheefe paſtor and teacher. The neceſſitie therfore of his Miniſterie and of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches required, that with a neceſſary and holy pride he ſhould vaunt of his vocation, and of the reuelation of the Goſpell made open vnto him by Chriſt, that their conſciences might be thorowly perſwaded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his doctrine was the true word of God.

For if the pure and certaine word of God be once taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, there remaineth no more conſolation, life, or ſaluation.

And with this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Neither vvas Titus compelled to be circumciſed, Paule</hi> was able to repreſſe and mightely conuince all his aduerſaries. As if he ſhould ſay: Why doth theſe counterfait apoſtles ſo falſely report of me, ſaying, that I am compelled to keepe circumciſion by the commaundement of the Apoſtles, ſeeing I haue the witnes of all the faithfull in Ieruſalem, and moreouer of all the Apoſtles them ſelues, that by my purſute and trauaile the contrary was there determined:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9456:50"/>
and that I did not onely there preuaile that <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould not be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, but that the Apoſtles did alſo approue and ratifie the ſame. Your counterfet apoſtles therfore do lie deadly, which ſclau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Apoſtles, and therby deceaue you: for I haue the Apoſtles and all the faithfull, not againſt me, but with me. And this I proue by the example of <hi>Titus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, <hi>Paule</hi> (as I haue often ſayd) did not condemne circumciſion as an vnprofitable thing, nor conſtrained any man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. For it is neither ſinne nor righteouſnes to be circumciſed or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, as it is neither ſinne nor righteouſnes to eate or drinke. <hi>For vvhether thou eate or eate not, thou art neither better nor vvorſe.</hi>

                  <p>Here <hi>Paule</hi> ſheweth the cauſe why he went vp to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and there conferred his goſpell with the other Apoſtles, and why he would not circumciſe <hi>Titus:</hi> Not that he might be the more certaine, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the goſpell by the Apoſtles, for he nothing doubted thereof: but that the truth of the goſpell might continue in the Churches of the Galathians, and in all the Churches of the Gentiles.

                  <p>Nowe, where he ſpeaketh of the truth of the Goſpell, he ſheweth that there be two goſpels, a true and a falſe goſpell. Indeede the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of it ſelfe is ſimple, true and ſincere, but by the malice of Satans miniſters it is corrupt and defaced. Therfore where he ſaith: <hi>The truth

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The truth of the goſpell, vvhat it is.</note>Now the truth of the goſpell is, that our righteouſnes cometh by Faith only without the workes of the law. The corruption or falſhode of the Goſpell is,<note place="margin">The corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the goſpell.</note> that we are iuſtified by Faith, but not without the workes of the lawe. With the like condition the falſe apoſtles alſo preached the Goſpel. Euen ſo doe our Papiſts and craftie Sophiſters at this day.<note place="margin">The doctrine of the Papiſtes concerning faith.</note> For they ſay that we muſt beleue in Chriſt, and that Faith is the foundation of our ſaluation: but it iuſtifieth not, except it be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with charitie. This is not the truth of the Goſpell, but falſhode and diſſimulation. But the true Goſpell in deede is, that works or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie are not the ornament or perfection of faith: but that faith of it ſelfe is Gods gift and Gods worke in our hearts, which therefore iuſtifieth vs becauſe it apprehendeth Chriſt our redemer. Mans reaſon hath the law for his obiect,<note place="margin">The obiect of reaſon.</note> thus thinking with it ſelfe: This I haue done, this I haue not done.

It loketh not to charitie. It ſayeth not: what haue I done? what haue I offended? what haue I deſerued? but what hath Chriſt done? what hath he deſerued? Here the truth of the goſpel anſwereth thee: he hath redemed thee from thy ſinne, from the Deuil &amp; from eternall death. Faith therefore acknowledgeth, that in this one perſon Ieſus Chriſt, it hath forgeuenes of ſinnes and eternall life. He that turneth his eyes away from this obiect, hath not true Faith but a fantaſie and a vaine opinion, and turneth his eyes from the promiſe to the law, which terrifieth and driueth to deſperation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:9456:51"/>Wherfore thoſe things which the Sophiſters &amp; Scholemen haue taught co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the iuſtifying faith being furniſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> charitie,<note place="margin">Faith adorned vvith charity.</note> are no thing elſe but mere dreames. For that faith which apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth Chriſt the ſonne of God &amp; is furniſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, is the ſame faith that iuſtifieth, and not that faith which includeth charitie. For a true &amp; a ſtedfaſt faith muſt lay hold vpon nothing elſe but Chriſt alone, and in the afflictions and terrours of conſcience it hath nothing elſe to leane vnto, but this Diamond Chriſt Ieſus.

This our aduerſaries vnderſtand not, and therfore they caſt away this precious Pearle Chriſt, &amp; in his place they ſet charitie, which they ſay is their precious Diamund. Now, when they can not tell what Faith is, it is vnpoſſible that they ſhould haue faith: much leſſe can they teach it vnto others. And as for that which they will ſeme to haue, it is nothing elſe but a very dreame, an opinion, and naturall reaſon, and not faith.</p>
                  <p>This I ſay, to the end ye may perceaue that <hi>Paule</hi> mentioning here the truth of the Goſpell, ſpeaketh with great feruencie of ſpirite for the more reproofe of the contrary. For by theſe wordes he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the falſe apoſtles, for that they had taught a falſe goſpell: for they required circumciſion &amp; the obſeruation of the law as neceſſary to ſaluation. Moreouer,<note place="margin">Sleights pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed of the falſe apoſtles againſt Paule.</note> they went about by craftie ſleights and policie to entrap <hi>Paule:</hi> for they watched him narowly, to ſee whether he would circumciſe <hi>Titus</hi> or no: Alſo whether he durſt withſtand them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Apoſtles, and for this cauſe he reprehendeth them bitterly. <hi>They vve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>to ſpie out our libertie vvhich vve haue in Chriſt Ieſu, that they might bring vs into bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage.</hi> Wherfore the falſe apoſtles armed them ſelues on euery ſide, that they might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince and confound him before the whole congregation.

ſought by all meanes to ſnare vs, and put vs to much trouble: but we ouercame them euen by the iudgement of the Apoſtles themſelues, and we would not yelde vnto them, no not one hower (for, no doubt, their drift was to haue cauſed <hi>Paule</hi> to ſurceaſe from this liberty for a time) ſithens we ſaw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they required the obſeruation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law as neceſſary to ſaluation.

But it was an other thing that they ſought, to witte, that they might bring <hi>Paule</hi> and all that ſtucke to his doctrine into bondage. Therefore he would not yelde vnto them, no not the ſpace of one moment.</p>
                  <p>In like maner doe we alſo offer to the Papiſtes all that is to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, yea and more then we ought.

                  <p>But ſome man will ſay: The lawe is diuine and holy.<note place="margin">The doctrine of the lavv.</note> Let the law haue his glory: but yet no law, be it neuer ſo diuine and holy, ought to teach me that I am iuſtified and ſhall liue through it. I graunt it may teach me that I ought to loue God and my neighbour: alſo to liue in chaſtitie, ſobernes, patience &amp;c. but it ought not to ſhew me how I ſhould be deliuered from ſinne, the Deuill, death and hell.

The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell willeth me to receaue this and to beleue it. And this is the truth of the Goſpell. It is alſo the principall article of all Chriſtian doctrine: wherein the knowledge of all godlines conſiſteth.

                  <p>To conclude, <hi>Paule</hi> would not circumciſe <hi>Titus,</hi> and (as he ſaith) for no other cauſe but for that certaine falſe brethren were crept in, to eſpie out their liberty, and would haue conſtrained <hi>Paule</hi> to circumciſe <hi>Titus.

                     <hi>vvas compelled to be circumciſed.</hi> If they had required this in the way of brotherly charitie, doubtles he would not haue denied it. But ſei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g they would haue done it as a neceſſary thing, and that by compulſion, to the ill example of others, to the ouerthrowing of the Goſpell and to bring mens conſciences into bondage, therefore he ſetteth himſelfe mightely againſt them, and preuailed ſo, that <hi>Titus</hi> was not circumciſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9456:53"/>It may ſeeme to be but a ſmall matter to be or not to be circumciſed.

For this vice is naturally grafted in vs, that we highly eſteeme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and outward appearance of men and more regard the ſame then the word of God.

                  <p>This the naturall man can not ſee: but the ſpirituall man onely diſcerneth the perſon from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word,<note place="margin">Euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God may be called the veile of God, becauſe God is, as it vvere couered and shadovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnder it.</note> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> veile of God from God himſelfe.

There is no fault in circumciſion or vncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (for circumciſion is nothing, and vncircumciſion is nothing) but in the vſe therof.

Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this word perſon comprehendeth the whole outward conuerſation of the Apoſtles which was holy, and their authoritie which was great. Notwithſtanding (ſayth he) God eſteemeth not theſe things: Not that he eſteemeth them not at all, but in the matter of iuſtification he regardeth them not, be they neuer ſo great and ſo glorious. For we muſt diligently marke this diſtinction, that in matters of diuinitie we muſt ſpeake farre otherwiſe then in matters of policy. In matters of policy (as I haue ſayd) God will haue vs to honour and reuerence theſe outward veiles or perſons as his inſtruments by whom he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth and preſerueth the world. But when the queſtion is touching religion, conſcience, the feare of God, faith and the ſeruice of God, we muſt not feare theſe outward perſons, we muſt put no affiance in them, loke for no comfort from them,<note place="margin">The outvvard perſon is not to be looked vpon in iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Deut. 1.</hi>

And this <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifieth in the .19.<note place="margin">Actes. 19.11.12.</note> of the Actes in theſe wordes: <hi>And God vvrought no ſmall miracles by the handes of Paule, ſo that from his body vvere brought napkins and handkercheefes, and the diſeaſes departed from them, and the euill ſpirites vvent out of them.</hi> Read more hereof in the .13.16.20.28. of the Actes.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, <hi>Paule</hi> wil be counted in no poynt inferiour to the reſt of the Apoſtles: and herein he ſtandeth with a godly and a holy pride. For he was compelled of neceſſitie to take vpon him ſtoutly againſt <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ſtoutnes of Paul is not carnall.</note> and the zeale of God conſtrained him to be proud whether he would or no.

For in that he did withdraw and vtterly ſeparate himſelfe, abſtaining from meates forbidden in the lawe (which notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtanding he had eaten of before) he miniſtred a ſcruple of conſcience to the faithfull, thus to gather vpon his example:<note place="margin">VVhat the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuing Ievves gathered of Peters abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> abſtaineth from meates forbidden in the law: therefore he that eateth meates forbidden in the law, ſinneth and tranſgreſſeth the law: but he that abſtaineth is righteous and kepeth the law, for els would not <hi>Peter</hi> haue withdrawn himſelfe. But becauſe he did ſo, and of purpoſe refuſed thoſe meates which before he did eate, it is a ſure argument that ſuch as eate againſt the law doe ſinne, and ſuch as abſtaine from meates which the law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth, doe keepe the law and are iuſtified thereby.</p>
                  <p>Here note, that the end of this facte of <hi>Peter</hi> is reproued of <hi>Paule,</hi> &amp; not the fact it ſelfe: for the facte in it ſelfe was not euill.<note place="margin">A facte is one thing and the end of a facte an other.</note> To eate and drinke, or not to eate &amp; drinke is nothing.

This <hi>Paule</hi> might in no wiſe diſſemble: for the truth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpell was here in daunger.

                  <p>This is a wonderfull example of ſuch excellent men and pillers of the church. There is none but <hi>Paule</hi> that hath his eies open and ſeeth the offence of <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Peter knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> 
                     <hi>Barnabas</hi> and the other Iewes which diſſembled with <hi>Peter.</hi> On the other ſide, they doe not ſee their owne offence: nay they rather thinke that they doe well in bearing with the infirmitie of the weake Iewes. Wherefore it was very neceſſary that <hi>Paule</hi> ſhould reproue their offence and not diſſemble it, and therefore he accuſeth <hi>Peter, Barnabas</hi> and other, that they went not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right way to the truth of the Goſpell: that is to ſay, they ſwarued from the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. It is a greate matter that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be accuſed of <hi>Paule</hi> as one that was falne from the truth of the Goſpell. He could not be more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly reprehended. Yet he ſuffered it patiently, and no doubt but he gladly acknowledged his offence. I ſayde before that many haue the Goſpell but not the truth of the Goſpell. So <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith here, that <hi>Peter, Barnabas and other of the Ievves vvent not the right vvay to the truthe of the Goſpell:</hi> that is to ſay, they had the Goſpell, but they walked not vprightly according to the Goſpell. For albeit they preached the Goſpell, yet through their diſſimulation (which could not ſtand with the truth of the Goſpell) they eſtabliſhed the law: but the eſtabliſhing of the law is the aboliſhing of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Who ſo then can rightly iudge betwene the lawe and the Goſpell, let him thanke God, and know that he is a right Diuine. In the time of tentation,<note place="margin">The difference of the lavve and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be learned.</note> I confeſſe that I my ſelfe doe not know how to doe it as I ought. Now, the way to diſcerne the one from the other, is to place the Goſpell in heauen and the lawe on the earth: to call the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Goſpell heauenly, and the righteouſnes of the law earthly: and to put as greate difference betwene the righteouſnes of the goſpell and of the law, as God hath made betwene heauen and earth, betwene
<pb facs="tcp:9456:63"/>
light and darkneſſe,<note place="margin">The difference betvvene the lavv and the Goſpell.</note> betweene daye and night. Lette the one be as the light and the day, and the other as the darkenes and the night. And would to God we could yet further ſeparate the one from the other. Wherefore if the queſtion be concerning the matter of faith or conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, let vs vtterly exclude the law, and leaue it on the earth: but if we haue to doe with works, then let vs lighten the lanterne of works and of the righteouſnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law. So let the Sunne &amp; the ineſtimable light of the Goſpell and grace ſhine in the day, and the lanterne of the law in the night. Wherefore if thy conſcience be terrified with the ſenſe and feeling of ſinne, thinke thus with thy ſelfe: Thou art now remaining vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth: there let the Aſſe labour and trauel: there let him ſerue and carry the burthen that is laid vpon him, that is to ſay, let the body with his members be ſubiect to the law. But when thou mounteſt vp into heauen, then leaue the Aſſe with his burthen on the earth: for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath nothing to doe with the law or works, or with the earthly righteouſnes. So doth the Aſſe remaine in the valley, but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience aſcendeth with <hi>Iſaac</hi> into the mountaine, knowing nothing at all of the law or workes thereof, but onely looking to the remiſſion of ſinnes and pure righteouſnes offered and freely geuen vnto vs in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">VVhen the lavv is to be vrged.</note>Contrariwiſe in ciuill policy, obedience to the law muſt be ſeuerely required. There nothing muſt be knowne as concerning the Goſpell, conſcience, grace, remiſſion of ſinnes, heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly righteouſnes, or Chriſt himſelfe: but <hi>Moſes</hi> onely with the law and the works thereof. If we marke well this diſtinction, neither the one nor the other ſhall paſſe his bounds, but the law ſhall abide without heauen, that is, without the heart and conſcience, and contrariwiſe the libertie of the Goſpell ſhall abide without the earth, that is to ſay, without the body and members thereof. Now therfore as ſoone as the law and ſinne come into heauen, that is,<note place="margin">The lavv hath nothing to do vvith the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> into the conſcience, let them by and by be caſt out. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being feared with the terrour of the wrath and iudgement of God, ought to know nothing of the law and ſinne, but of Chriſt onely. And on the other ſide, when grace and liberty come into the earth, that is, into the body, then ſay: thou oughteſt not to dwell in the dregges and dunghill of this corporall life, but thou belongeſt vnto heauen.</p>
                  <p>This diſtinction of the law and the Goſpell <hi>Peter</hi> confounded through his diſſimulation, and therby perſwaded the beleuing Iewes that they muſt be iuſtified by the Goſpell and the law together.

For as a Gentile which is free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, thou eateſt common &amp; vncleane meates, &amp; therin thou doeſt well.

<pb facs="tcp:9456:64"/>
For in that thou abſtaineſt from profane meates, thou geueſt occaſion to the Gentiles thus to thinke: <hi>Peter</hi> abſtaineth from thoſe meates which the Gentiles vſe to eate, which alſo he himſelfe before did eate, therefore we ought likewiſe to auoid the ſame, and to liue after the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Here I ſay againe, that to liue as the Iew, is not euil of it ſelfe, for it is a thing indifferent either to eate ſwines fleſh or any other meates.

Notwithſtanding by thy example thou conſtraineſt the Gentiles to forſake Chriſt and to returne to the lawe. For thou geueſt them occaſion thus to thinke: Faith onely is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to righteouſnes, but the law and works are alſo required. And this <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth vs by his example. Therfore the obſeruation of the law muſt needes be ioyned with faith in Chriſt if we wilbe ſaued. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter</hi> by this example is not onely preiudicial to the purity of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,<note place="margin">Peters errour.</note> but alſo to the truth of faith and chriſtian righteouſnes. For the Gentiles receaued this of him, that the keping of the law was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to righteouſnes: which errour in caſe it be admitted, then Chriſt profiteth nothing.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it plainly appeareth to what end this diſcord betwene <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> tendeth. <hi>Paule</hi> doth nothing by diſſimulation, but dealeth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and goeth plainly to worke. <hi>Peter</hi> diſſembleth, but this diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>Paule</hi> reproueth.

And what is this els but to make of God a tyranne and a tormentor, which requireth of vs that we are not able to performe.

And becauſe God is not contente that we fulfill the law according to the ſubſtance of the deede, but will haue vs alſo to fulfill the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaning of the Commaunder: therefore the ſcripture further compelleth vs to haue a qualitie aboue nature poured into vs from aboue, and that is charitie which they call formall righteouſnes adorning and bewtifying faith, being alſo the cauſe that faith iuſtifieth vs. So faith is the body, and the ſhell: charitie the life, the kernell, the forme and furniture.

And this is that formall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, whereby a man is iuſtified, and not by charitie, as the popiſh Scholemen do affirme.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, like as the Scholemen ſay that charity furniſheth and adorneth faith: ſo do we ſay that it is Chriſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furniſheth and adorneth faith, or rather that he is the very forme &amp; perfection of faith.

                     <p>We therfore doe make this definition of a Chriſtian man: that he is a right chriſtian to whom God imputeth not his ſinne,<note place="margin">VVho is a right Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> through faith in Chriſt. This doctrine bringeth great conſolation to poore afflicted conſciences in ſerious and inward terrours.

Therefore when the lawe accuſeth and ſinne terrifieth him, he looketh vpon Chriſt, and when he hath appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him by faith, he hath preſent with him the conquerour of the law, ſinne, death, and the deuill: who raigneth and ruleth ouer them, ſo that they can not hurt him. Wherfore a Chriſtian man, if ye define him rightly, is free from all lawes, and is not ſubiect vnto any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, either within or without: In that he is a Chriſtian (I ſay) and not in that he is a man or a woman, that is to ſay, in that he hath his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience adorned and bewtified with this faith, with this great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable treaſure,<note place="margin">1.

although it ſeemeth to be but litle, yet notwithſtanding the ſmalnes therof is greater then heauen and earth: for Chriſt which is this gift and this treaſure is greater then all things.</p>
                     <p>Whiles this doctrine pacifying and quieting the conſcience abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſound and vncorrupt, Chriſtians are made iudges ouer all kindes of doctrine, and are Lords ouer the lawes of the whole world.<note place="margin">Chriſtians are Iudges of all kindes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctryne.</note> Then ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they certainly iudge that the <hi>Turke</hi> with his <hi>Alcoran</hi> is damned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he goeth not the right way, that is, he acknowledgeth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be miſerable and damnable, nor apprehendeth Chriſt by faith, for whoſe ſake he might be aſſured that his ſinnes are pardoned. In like maner they boldly pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſentence againſt the Pope,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the Pope.</note> that he is condemned with all his kingdome, becauſe he ſo walketh and ſo tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth (with all his religious rable of Sophiſters and Scholeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>), that by the merite of congruence we muſt come to grace, &amp; that afterwards by the merite of worthines we are receaued into heauen. Here ſayth the Chriſtian, this is not the right way to iuſtifie vs, neither doth this way leade vs to heauen. For I can not (ſaith he) by my works going before grace, deſerue grace, nor by my works following grace deſerue eternall life: But to him that beleueth, ſinne is pardoned and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes imputed. This truſt and this confidence maketh him the childe of God and heire of his kingdome: For in hope he poſſeſſeth already euerlaſting life aſſured vnto him by promiſe.

as the merite of congruence &amp; worthines, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> difference of daies, meates, vowes, inuocation of Saincts, pilgrimages, purgatory &amp; ſuch like.

                     <p>And this the thing it ſelfe doth well declare. For they take that priuiledge vnto them ſelues which belongeth vnto Chriſt alone. He onely forgeueth ſinnes, he onely geueth righteouſnes and euerlaſting life: and they moſt impudently and wickedly doe vaunte that they are able to obtaine theſe things by their owne merits and worthines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after grace. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles call theſe damnable hereſies and ſects of perdition. For by theſe meanes they deny Chriſt, treade his bloud vnder their feete, blaſpheme the holy Ghoſt, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe the grace of God.<note place="margin">Papiſticall I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie.</note> Wherefore no man can ſufficiently conceaue how horrible the idolatry of the Papiſtes is. As ineſtimable as the gifte is which is offered vnto vs by Chriſt: euen ſo and no leſſe abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable are theſe prophanations of the Papiſtes. They ought not then to be lightly eſteemed or forgotten: but diligently wayed &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. And this maketh alſo very much for the amplifying of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God and benefite of Chriſt, as by the contrarye. For the more we know the prophanation of the papiſticall Maſſe, ſo much the more we doe abhorre and deteſt the ſame, and embrace the true vſe of the holy communion,<note place="margin">The true vſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion taken avvay by the Pope.</note> which the Pope hath taken away, and hath made mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being bought for money, it might profite others.

                     <p>Wherefore euen by this we may plainely ſee the ineſtimable paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, in that he hath not long agoe deſtroyed the whole Papacy and conſumed it with fire and brimſtone, as he did <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorre.</hi> But now theſe ioly felowes goe about, not onely to couer, but highly to aduance their impietie and filthines.

                  <p>Horrible and vnſpeakeable is the wrath of God, in that he hath ſo long time puniſhed the contempt of the Goſpell and of Chriſt in the Papiſtes, and alſo their ingratitude, geuing them ouer into a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſenſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.28.</note> in ſo much that they blaſpheming and denying Chriſt alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as touching his office, in ſtede of the goſpell haue receaued the execrable rules,<note place="margin">VVith the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, mans tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditions are preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.</note> ordinaunces and traditions of men, which they haue deuoutly adored and honoured, yea and preferred the ſame farre aboue the word of God, vntill at length they were forbidden to marry, and were bound to that inceſtuous ſingle life: wherein they were outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

One of theſe two muſt needes be falſe. Either we are not iuſtified by Chriſt, or we are not iuſtified by the lawe. But the truth is, that we are iuſtified by Chriſt: therefore we are not iuſtified by the lawe.

(I ſay) of the obſeruation of the lawe to iuſtifie vs, ſo that they which are righteous in Chriſt are not righteous, but haue yet neede of the lawe to iuſtifie them: Or if he that is iuſtified by Chriſt muſt yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be iuſtified by the lawe, then is Chriſt nothing elſe but a lawgeuer and a miniſter of ſinne. Therfore he that is iuſtified and holy in Chriſt, is not iuſtified or holy, but hath yet neede of the righteouſnes and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the lawe.</p>
                  <p>But we are in deede iuſtified and made righteous in Chriſt: For the truth of the Goſpell teacheth vs that a man is not iuſtified in the lawe, but in Chriſt. Nowe, if they which are iuſtified in Chriſt are yet found ſinners, that is, doe yet ſtill belong to the lawe, and are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lawe (as the falſe Apoſtles teach) then are they not yet iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. For the lawe accuſeth them, and ſheweth them to be yet ſinners: It requireth of them the workes of the lawe as neceſſary to their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and ſo it foloweth that Chriſt is not a iuſtifier, but a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the lawe.</p>
                  <p>With theſe wordes he vehemently chargeth the falſe Apoſtles and all Meritemongers,<note place="margin">The Iuſticia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries make Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Chriſt, and the lavve grace.</note> that they peruerte altogether: for they make of the lawe grace and of grace the lawe, of <hi>Moſes</hi> Chriſt and of Chriſt <hi>Moſes.</hi> For they teach that beſides Chriſt and all the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Chriſt, the obſeruation of the lawe is neceſſary to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And thus we ſee that by their intolerable peruerſnes they make the lawe Chriſt: for by this meanes they attribute that to the lawe, which properly belongeth vnto Chriſt. If thou doe the workes of the lawe (ſay they) thou ſhalt be ſaued: but if thou doe them not, thou ſhalt not be iuſtified although thou doe beleue in Chriſt neuer ſo much. Now, if it be ſo that Chriſt iuſtifieth not, but is the miniſter of ſinne (as it muſt needes folowe by their doctrine) then is Chriſt the lawe: for we haue nothing elſe of him, ſeeing he teacheth that we are ſinners, then that we haue by the lawe. So Chriſt being the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of ſinne, ſendeth vs to the lawe and to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as to our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifier.</p>
                  <p>It can not be therfore but that the Papiſts and all ſuch as are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes of Chriſt, or haue not the true knowlege ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, muſt nedes make of Chriſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and the law, &amp; of the law Chriſt.

                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:9456:74"/>
Here euen at the firſt daſh Chriſt is denied and Faith aboliſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is attributed to the commaundements of God or to the lawe, which belongeth to Chriſt alone. For Chriſt,<note place="margin">Chriſt.</note> according to his true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, is a Iuſtifier and a Redemer from ſinnes. If I attribute this to the lawe, then is the lawe my Iuſtifier, deliuering me from my ſinnes, becauſe I do the workes therof and ſo nowe the lawe is Chriſt, and Chriſt vtterly loſeth his name, his office and glory, and is nothing elſe but a miniſter of the lawe, reprouing, accuſing, terrifying, preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſending the ſinner to an other, that may iuſtifie him: which is the proper office of the lawe.</p>
                  <p>But the proper office of Chriſt is, after the lawe hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a man to be giltie, to raiſe him vp againe, and to looſe him from his ſinnes, if he beleue the Goſpell. For to all that doe beleue,<note place="margin">

And this is in deede (although they will ſay otherwiſe) their principall propoſition: That Chriſt is Moſes.<note place="margin">Meritemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers ſcorne the true preachers of faith.</note> Moreouer they deride and mocke vs, becauſe we doe ſo diligently teach, and ſo earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Faith. Ha ha (ſay they) faith faith: wait thou the time vntil thou come to heauen by faith. Nay, thou muſt ſtriue to doe greater &amp; waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier matters.

                     <hi>Doe this and thou shalt line.</hi> Faith which ye ſo highly extoll, doth nothing elſe but make men careles, idle, and negligent. Thus are they become nothing elſe but miniſters of the law, and laweworkers, calling backe the people from baptiſme, faith, the promiſes of Chriſt, to the law and workes, turning grace into the law, and the law into grace.</p>

Where is nowe the diſtinction and difference of the lawe and grace? In deede they doe diſtinguiſh them in name, but in effect they call grace charitie. Thus doe all they which ſo ſtraitly require the obſeruation of the lawe, and attribute iuſtification to the law and works. Wherfore who ſo euer do not perfectly vnderſtand the article of iuſtification, muſt needes confound and mingle the lawe and grace together.</p>
                  <p>Let euery man therfore diligently learne aboue all things to put a difference betwene the lawe and grace in deede and in practiſe: not in words onely as the Pope and the fantaſticall Anabaptiſts do: Who as touching the words, doe confeſſe that they are two diſtinct things: but in very deede (as I haue ſayd) they confound &amp; mingle them together: for they will not graunt that faith iuſtifieth without workes.

But if iuſtification cometh by the lawe, then cometh it not by grace. Now, if iuſtification cometh not by grace, but by the lawe, what hath Chriſt done and wrought by his death, by his preaching, by his victorie which he hath obtained ouer the lawe, ſinne and death, and by ſending the holy Ghoſt?

But if the aduerſaries wil needes defend this doctrine, why do they not then reiect faith in Chriſt altogether: eſpecially ſeing they make nothing els of it but a vaine qualitie in the ſoule, which without Chriſt auaileth nothing? why doe they not ſay in plaine wordes that workes doe iuſtifie and not faith?

By this meanes Chriſt is no Sauiour, no geuer of grace, but a cruell tirant, which requireth ſuch things (as <hi>Moſes</hi> did) which no man is able to performe. See how all the meritmongers doe take Chriſt to be but a new lawgeuer, and the Goſpell to be nothing els but a certaine booke which containeth new lawes concerning works, as the <hi>Turkes</hi> dreame of their <hi>Alcoran.</hi> But as touching lawes, there is enough in <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Goſpell then is a preaching of Chriſt,<note place="margin">The Goſpell vvhat it is.</note> which forgeueth ſinnes, geueth grace, iuſtifieth and ſaueth ſinners.

                  <p>To conclude, if the lawe be the miniſtery of ſinne, then is it alſo the miniſtery of wrath and of death.

                  <p>And here <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh not of the ceremoniall lawe onely, (as before we haue declared more at large) but of the whole law, whether it be ceremoniall or morall: which to a Chriſtian is vtterly abrogate,<note place="margin">That the lavv is abrogated.</note> for he is dead vnto it.

                     <note place="margin">Chriſt free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the graue.</note>As for example: Chriſt riſing from death is free from the graue, and yet the graue remaineth ſtil. <hi>Peter</hi> is deliuered from the priſon, the ſicke of the palſey from his bed, the yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from his coffen, the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from her couch, and yet the priſon, the bed, the coffen, the couch doe remaine ſtill. Euen ſo the lawe is aboliſhed when I am not ſubiect vnto it, the law is dead when I am dead vnto it, &amp; yet it remaineth ſtill. But becauſe I die vnto it by an other law, it dieth alſo vnto me: As the graue of Chriſt, the priſon of <hi>Peter,</hi> the couch of the maiden. &amp;c. do ſtill remaine, and yet Chriſt by his reſurrection dieth to the graue, <hi>Peter</hi> by his deliueraunce is freed from the priſon, and the maid through life is deliuered from the couch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">I am dead to the lavv.</note>Wherfore theſe words: <hi>I am dead to the lavv,</hi> are very effectuall. For he ſayeth not: I am free from the law for a time, or I am Lord of the lawe: but ſimplie, I am dead to the lawe, that is to ſay, I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the law. <hi>Paule</hi> could haue vttred nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g more effectually againſt iuſtification of the law, then to ſay: I am dead to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, that is, I care nothing at all for the law: therfore I am not iuſtified by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">VVhat it is to die to the lavve.</note>Now, to die to the law, is, not to be bound to the law, but to be free from the law &amp; not to know it.

The ſouldiers were aſtoniſhed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the graue: and they alſo which ſaw the maiden raiſed vp from death to life, were amazed. So mans reaſon and wiſedom is aſtoniſhed and becometh fooliſh when it heareth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are not iuſtified, except we be dead to the law: for it is not able to reach vnto this myſterie. But we know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when we apprehend Chriſt by faith inwardly in conſcience, we enter into a certain new law, which ſwaloweth vp the old law that held vs captiues. As the graue in which Chriſt lay dead, after that he was riſen againe, was voide and emptie, and Chriſt vaniſhed away: ſo when I beleue in Chriſt, I riſe againe with him, and die to my graue, that is to ſay, the lawe, which held me captiue: So that now the law is voide, and I am eſcaped out of my priſon and graue, that is to ſay, the lawe.

                  <p>It is neceſſary y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mens conſciences ſhould be diligently inſtructed,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9456:81"/>
that they may wel vnderſtand the difference betwene y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> righteouſnes of the law &amp; grace. The righteouſnes of grace or the libertie of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience doth in no wiſe pertaine to the fleſh. For the fleſh may not be at liberty,<note place="margin">The flesh is ſubiect to the lavve, but not to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> but muſt remaine in the graue, the priſon, the couch: it muſt be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to the law, and exerciſed by the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> But the chriſtian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt be dead to the law, that is to ſay, free from the law, &amp; muſt haue nothing at all to doe with it. It is good to know this: for it helpeth very much to the comforting of poore afflicted conſciences. Wherfore when you ſee a man terrified and caſt downe with the ſenſe and feeling of his ſinne, ſay vnto him: Brother, thou doeſt not rightly diſtinguiſh. Thou placeſt the lawe in thy conſcience, which ſhould be placed in the fleſh. Awake, ariſe vp, and remember that thou muſt beleue in Chriſt the conquerour of the lawe and ſinne. With this faith thou ſhalt mount vp aboue and beyond the lawe into that heauen of grace where is no law nor ſinne. And albeit the law &amp; ſinne doe ſtill remaine, yet they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nothing to thee: for thou art dead to the lawe and ſinne.</p>
                  <p>This is eaſily ſayd: but bleſſed is he which knoweth howe to lay ſure hold on theſe things in time of diſtreſſe, that is, which can ſay, when ſinne ouerwayeth him, and the law accuſeth him: what is this to me, O lawe, that thou accuſeſt me, and ſayeſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnes? In deede I graunt that I haue committed many ſinnes, yea and yet ſtil I doe commit ſinnes daily without number. This toucheth me nothing: I am now deafe, and can not heare: therefore thou talkeſt to me in vaine, for I am dead vnto thee. But if thou wilt needes diſpute with me as touching my ſinnes, get thee to the fleſh and members, my ſeruaunts: teach them, exerciſe and crucifie them. But trouble not me <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which am a Ladie and a Queene, and haue nothing to doe with thee: for I am dead to thee, and now I liue to Chriſt,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience anſvvering to the accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the lavve.</note> with whom I am vnder an other lawe, to witte, the lawe of grace, which ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ouer ſinne and the lawe. By what meanes? By faith in Chriſt, as <hi>Paule</hi> declareth hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But this ſemeth a ſtraunge and a wonderfull definition, that to liue to the lawe is to die to God: and to die to the lawe, is to liue to God. Theſe two propoſitions are cleane contrary to reaſon, and therefore no craftie Sophiſter or lawworker can vnderſtand them. But learne thou the true vnderſtanding thereof. He that liueth to the lawe, that is, ſeketh to be iuſtified by the workes of the lawe, is and remaineth a ſinner: therfore he is dead &amp; condemned. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law can not iuſtifie and ſaue him, but accuſeth, terrifieth, &amp; killeth him. Therfore to
<pb facs="tcp:9456:82"/>
liue vnto the law, is to die vnto God: and contrariwiſe, to die to the law is to liue vnto God. Wherefore if thou wilt liue vnto God, thou muſt die to the lawe: but if thou wilt liue to the lawe, thou ſhalt die to God. Now,<note place="margin">To liue vnto God.</note> to liue vnto God, is to be iuſtified by grace or by faith for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſake, without the lawe and workes.</p>
                  <p>This is then the proper and true definition of a Chriſtian, that he is the childe of grace and remiſſion of ſinnes,<note place="margin">VVho is a Chriſtian.</note> becauſe he is vnder no lawe, but is aboue the lawe, ſinne, death, and hell. And euen as Chriſt is free from the graue, and <hi>Peter</hi> from the priſon, ſo is a Chriſtian free from the lawe. And ſuch a reſpect there is betwene the iuſtified conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and the lawe, as is betwene Chriſt raiſed vp from the graue, and the graue: and as is betwene <hi>Peter</hi> deliuered from the priſon, and the priſon. And like as Chriſt by his death and reſurrection is dead to the graue, ſo that it hath now no power ouer him, nor is able any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to holde him, but the ſtone being rolled away, the ſeales broken, and the kepers aſtoniſhed, he riſeth againe and goeth away without any let: and as <hi>Peter</hi> by his deliueraunce is freed from the priſon, &amp; goeth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will: euen ſo the conſcience by grace is deliuered from the law. So is euery one that is borne of the ſpirite. But the fleſh knoweth not from whence this cometh, nor whether it goeth, for it can not iudge but after the lawe. But on the contrary, the ſpirite ſayeth: let the law accuſe me, let ſinne and death terrifie me neuer ſo much, yet I doe not therfore deſpaire: for I haue the lawe againſt the lawe, ſinne againſt ſinne, and death againſt death.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when I feele the remorſe and ſting of conſcience for ſinne, I behold that braſen ſerpent Chriſt hanging vppon the croſſe. There I finde an other ſinne againſt my ſinne which accuſeth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth me. Now this other ſinne, namely in the fleſh of Chriſt, which taketh away the ſinnes of the world, is almightie: it condemneth and ſwaloweth vp my ſinne. So my ſinne is condemned by ſinne, that is, by Chriſt crucified:<note place="margin">1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <hi>vvho is made ſinne for vs, that vve might be made the righteouſnes of God through him.</hi> In like maner I finde death in my fleſh, which afflicteth and killeth me: but I haue in me a contrary death,<note place="margin">Death againſt death.</note> which is the death: for this death crucifieth and ſwalow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vp my death.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things be not done by the lawe or workes, but by Chriſt crucified: vppon whoſe ſhoulders lie all the euils of mankinde, the lawe, ſinne, death, the Deuill, and hell: and all theſe doe die in him, for by his death he hath killed them. But we muſt receaue this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9456:82"/>
benefite of Chriſt with a ſure faith. For like as neither the lawe nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worke thereof is offered vnto vs, but Chriſt alone: ſo nothing is required of vs but Faith alone, whereby we apprehend Chriſt, and beleue that our ſinnes and our death are condemned and aboliſhed in the ſinne and death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus haue we alwayes moſt certaine and ſure arguments, which neceſſarily conclude that iuſtification cometh by faith alone.<note place="margin">The lavve ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs not righteous, but faith onely.</note> For how ſhould the lawe and workes auaile to iuſtification, ſeeing that <hi>Paule</hi> is ſo earneſt both againſt the lawe and workes, and ſayeth plainely that we muſt be dead to the lawe, if we will liue to God. But if we be dead to the lawe, and the lawe be dead to vs, then hath it nothing to doe with vs. How then ſhould it auaile any thing at all to our iuſtification? Wherefore we muſt needes ſay, that we be iuſtified by grace alone, or by faith alone in Chriſt, without the lawe and workes.</p>
                  <p>This the blinde Sophiſters doe not vnderſtand, and therefore they dreame that Faith iuſtifieth not except it doe the workes of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. By this meanes Faith which beleueth in Chriſt becometh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and of none effect: for the vertue of iuſtifying is taken from it except it be furniſhed with charitie. But let vs nowe ſet aparte the lawe and charitie vntil an other time, &amp; let vs reſt onely vpon the poynt of this preſent matter: which is this,<note place="margin">The very poynt of all this matter.</note> that Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God died vpon the croſſe, did beare in his body my ſinnes, the lawe, death, the Deuill and hell. Theſe inuincible enemies and tyrannes doe oppreſſe, vexe, and trouble me, and therefore I am carefull howe I may be deliuered out of their handes, iuſtified and ſaued. Here I finde neither lawe, worke nor charitie which is able to deliuer me from their tyrannie. There is none but the Lord Ieſus onely and alone, which taketh away the lawe, killeth and deſtroyeth my death in his body, and by this meanes ſpoyleth hell, iudgeth, and crucifieth the Deuill, and throweth him downe into hell. To be briefe, all the enemies which did before torment and oppreſſe me, Chriſt Ieſus hath brought to naught: <hi>Hath ſpoyled them, and made a shevv of them openly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.15.</note> 
                     <hi>triumphing by him ſelfe ouer them,</hi> in ſuch ſort that they can nowe rule and raigne no more ouer me, but are conſtrained to obey me.</p>
                  <p>By this we may plainely ſee,<note place="margin">In the matter of iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for vs to doe, but to heare vvhat Chriſt hath done for vs, &amp; to apprehend the ſame by faith.</note> that there is nothing here for vs to doe.

Now, when I haue thus apprehended Chriſt by faith, and through him am dead to the

lawe, iuſtified from ſinne, deliuered from death, the deuill, and hell, then I doe good works, I loue God, I geue thankes to him, I exerciſe charitie towardes my neighbour.<note place="margin">Good vvorks.</note> But this charitie or workes folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do neither forme nor adorne my faith, but my faith formeth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorneth charitie.

True it is that euery man is tempted: if not in his life, yet at his death. There, when the law accuſeth him and ſheweth vnto him his ſinnes, his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience by and by ſaith:<note place="margin">A ſpeeche or Dialoge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvene the lavv and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> Thou haſt ſinned.

Why, doth not the lawe of God ſo ſay? I haue nothing to doe with that lawe. Why ſo? Becauſe I haue an other lawe which ſtriketh this lawe dumme,<note place="margin">The lavve of libertie.</note> that is to ſay, libertie.<note place="margin">A conſolation againſt the terrours of the lavv. &amp;c.</note> What libertie is that? The libertie of Chriſt, for by Chriſt I am vtterly freed from the lawe. Therfore that lawe which is &amp; remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a law to the wicked, is to me libertie, and bindeth that law which would condemne me: And by this meanes that lawe which would bind me and hold me captiue, is now faſt bound it ſelfe, and holden captiue by grace and libertie, which is now my lawe: which ſayth to that accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing law:<note place="margin">The binding lavv through Chriſt, is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it ſelfe.</note> Thou ſhalt not hold this man bound &amp; captiue, for he is mine: but I wil hold thee in captiuitie, and bind thy hands that thou ſhalt not hurt him, for he liueth now vnto Chriſt, and is dead vnto thee.</p>
                  <p>This to do, is to daſh out the teeth of the lawe, to wraſt his ſting and all his weapons from him, and to ſpoile him of all his force. And yet the ſame law notwithſtanding continueth and remaineth ſtil to the wicked and vnbeleuers: And to vs alſo that be weake, ſo farre forth as we lacke faith, it continueth yet ſtill in his force: here it hath his edge &amp; teeth. But if I do beleue in Chriſt, although ſinne driue me neuer ſo much to deſpaire, yet ſtaying vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this libertie which I haue in Chriſt, I confeſſe that I haue ſinned:<note place="margin">Sinne conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning.</note> but my ſinne which is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned ſinne, is in Chriſt which is a condemning ſinne. Now this condemning ſinne
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9456:83"/>
is ſtronger then that which is condemned: for it is iuſtifying grace, righteouſnes, life &amp; ſaluation. Thus when I feele the terrour of death, I ſay: Thou haſt nothing to doe with me O death,<note place="margin">Death killed, and death kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> for I haue an other death which killeth thee my death, &amp; that death which killeth, is ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then that which is killed.</p>
                  <p>Thus a faithfull man by faith onely in Chriſt, may raiſe vppe him ſelfe, and conceaue ſuch ſure and ſound conſolation, that he ſhall not neede to feare the deuill, ſinne, death, or any euils. And although the Deuill ſet vpon him with all might and maine, and goe about with all the terrours of the world to oppreſſe him,<note place="margin">As Satan is to others ouer vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath dominion, ſo is Chriſt to Sathan vvhom he holdeth bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that he can not hurt vs farther, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he geueth him leaue. <hi>1.

                     </note> yet he conceaueth good hope euen in the middes therof, and thus he ſayth: Sir Deuill, I feare not thy threatninges &amp; terrours, for ther is one whoſe name is Ieſus Chriſt, in whom I beleue: he hath aboliſhed the law, condemned ſinne, vanquiſhed death and deſtroyed hell: and he is thy Tormentor O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, for he hath bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thee, and holdeth thee captiue, to the end that thou ſhouldeſt no more hurt me, or any that beleueth in him.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> therfore through a vehement zeale and indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſpirit, calleth grace it ſelfe the lawe,<note place="margin">VVhy Paule calleth grace the lavve.</note> which notwithſtanding is an exceding &amp; ineſtimable libertie of grace which we haue in Chriſt Ieſu. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he geueth this opprobrious name vnto the law for our conſolation, to let vs vnderſtand that there is a new name geuen vnto it: to witte, that it is not now aliue any more, but dead and condemned. And here (which is a pleaſant ſight to behold) he bringeth forthe the lawe, and ſetteth it before vs as a theefe and a robber, which is already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and adiudged to death. For he deſcribeth it as it were a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner hauing both handes and feete faſt bound,<note place="margin">The lavve bound and condemned cannot accuſe vs.</note> and all his power taken away, ſo that it can not exerciſe his tyrannie, that is to ſay, it can not accuſe and condemne any more: And with this moſt pleaſaunt ſight he maketh it odious and contemptible to the conſcience: ſo that now he which beleueth in Chriſt dare boldly and with a holy pride triumph ouer the lawe after this maner. I am a ſinner:<note place="margin">A holy pride.</note> If thou canſt doe any thing againſt me, O lawe, nowe doe thy worſt. So farre of is it then that the law is now terrible vnto him which doth beleue.</p>
                  <p>Since Chriſt is riſen from death, why ſhould he nowe feare the
<pb facs="tcp:9456:84"/>
graue? Since <hi>Peter</hi> is deliuered from the priſon, why ſhould he now feare it? When the maiden was at the point of death, then might ſhe in deede feare the bedde: but being now reiſed vp, why ſhould ſhe feare it? In like maner, why ſhould a Chriſtian which enioyeth and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſt by faith, feare the law? True it is that he feeleth the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the law, but he is not ouercome of them: but ſtaying vpon the libertie which he hath in Chriſt, he ſaith: I heare thee murmuring O law, that thou wouldeſt accuſe and condemne me: but this troubleth me nothing at all. Thou art to me as the graue was vnto Chriſt. For I ſee that thou art faſt bound hand and foote: and this hath my lawe done.<note place="margin">Hovv he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth libertie the lavv.</note> What law is that? libertie, which is called the law, not becauſe it bindeth me, but becauſe it bindeth my law. The law of the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements did bind me. But againſt that law I haue an other law, euen the law of grace:<note place="margin">The lavv of grace binding the lavv of the ten commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</note> which notwithſtanding is to me no law, neither doth it bind me, but ſetteth me at liberty. And this is a law againſt that accuſing and condemning law: which law it ſo bindeth, that it hath no power to hurt me any more. So againſt my death which bindeth me, I haue an other death,<note place="margin">Death killed by death: that is the death vvhich vvas due to me, is killed by Chriſtes death</note> that is to ſay, life, which quickneth me in Chriſt: and this death looſeth and freeth me from the bondes of my death, and with the ſame bondes bindeth my death. So death which bound me, is now faſt bound, which killed me, is now killed by death, that is to ſay, by life it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſt with moſt ſweete names is called my law, my ſinne, my death,<note place="margin">The ſvveete and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table names of Chriſt.</note> againſt the law, againſt ſinne, againſt death: wheras in very deede he is nothing els but meere libertie, righteouſnes, life and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſaluation. And for this cauſe he is made the law of the law, the ſinne of ſinne, the death of death, that he might redeme me from the curſe of the law, iuſtifie me and quicken me. So then, whiles Chriſt is the lawe, he is alſo libertie, whiles he is ſinne he is righteouſnes, and whiles he is death he is life. For in that he ſuffered the law to accuſe him, ſinne to condemne him and death to deuoure him, he aboliſhed the law, he condemned ſinne, he deſtroied death, he iuſtified and ſaued me. So is Chriſt the poiſon of the law,<note place="margin">Chriſt a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt death.</note> ſinne, and death, and the remedy for the obtaining of libertie, righteouſnes, and euerlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>This maner of ſpeach which <hi>Paule</hi> here vſeth and is proper vnto him alone,<note place="margin">The lavv of the mind ſette againſt the lavv of the members.</note> is full of conſolation. Likewiſe in the .7. chapter to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines he ſetteth the law of the ſpirite againſt the law of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, And becauſe this is a ſtraunge and a maruelous manner of ſpeaking, therfore it entreth more eaſily into the mind and ſticketh faſter in the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9456:84"/>
memorie. Moreouer, when he ſaith: <hi>I through the lavv am dead to the lavv,</hi> it ſoundeth more ſwetely then if he ſhould ſay: I through li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie am dead to the law. For he ſetteth before vs as it were a certaine picture: as if the law were fighting againſt the law. As though he ſhould ſay: O law, if thou canſt accuſe me, terrifie me, and bind me, I will ſet aboue and againſt thee an other law, that is to ſay, an other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor, which ſhall accuſe thee, bind thee and triumph ouer thee. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou art thus bound and ſuppreſſed, then am I at libertie. So then grace is a law, not to me, for it bindeth me not, but to my law: which this law ſo bindeth that it can not hurt me any more.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Paule</hi> goeth about to draw vs wholy from the beholding of the law, ſinne, death, &amp; all other euils, and to bring vs vnto Chriſt,<note place="margin">A moſt ioyfull combat.</note> that there we might behold this ioyfull conflict: to witte, the law fighting againſt the law, that it may be to me libertie: ſinne againſt ſinne, that it may be to me righteouſnes: death againſt death, that I may obtaine life: Chriſt fighting againſt the Deuill, that I may be the child of God: and deſtroying hell that I may enioy the kingdome of heauen.</p>

So Chriſt liuing and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in me, taketh away and ſwalloweth vp all euils which vexe and afflict me. This vnion or coniunction then is the cauſe that I am deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the terrour of the law and ſinne, am ſeperate from my ſelf, and tranſlated vnto Chriſt and his kingdom, which is a kingdom of grace, righteouſnes, peace, ioy, life, ſaluation, &amp; eternal glory. Thus I now abiding and dwelling in him, what euill is there that can hurt me?</p>
                  <p>In the meane ſeaſon the old man abideth without and is ſubiecte to the lawe: but as concerning iuſtification, Chriſt and I muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly conioyned and vnited together, ſo that he may liue in me and I in him. And this is a wonderful maner of ſpeech. Now, becauſe Chriſt liueth in me,<note place="margin">VVhatſoeuer good the god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly haue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is Chriſtes, and vve are ſo knit together, that he liueth in vs and vve in him.</note> therefore looke what grace, righteouſnes, life, peace, and ſaluation is in me, it is his, and yet notwithſtanding the ſame is mine alſo by that vnſeparable vnion and coniunction which is throughe Faithe: by which Chriſte and I are made as it were one bodye in ſpirite. For as much then as Chriſt liueth in me, it foloweth, that as I muſt nedes be with him pertaker of grace, righteouſnes, life, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation: ſo the lawe, ſinne, and death can haue no place in me: yea the lawe is crucified and ſwallowed vp of the lawe, ſinne of ſinne, and death of death. Thus <hi>Paule</hi> goeth about to draw vs from the beholding of our ſelues, the law &amp; workes, and to plant in vs true faith in Chriſt: ſo that in the matter of iuſtification we ſhould thinke vpon nothing elſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9456:86"/>
but grace, ſeparating the ſame farre from the law and works, which in this matter ought to haue no place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> hath his peculiar phraſe or kind of ſpeach,<note place="margin">Paules exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly maner of ſpeach.</note> which is not after the maner of men, but diuine and heauenly: nor vſed of the Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes or of the reſt of the Apoſtles, ſauing only of Iohn, who alſo is wont ſometimes ſo to ſpeake. And if <hi>Paule</hi> had not firſt vſed this phraſe and ſet forth the ſame vnto vs in plaine words, the very Saincts the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues durſt not haue vſed it. For it ſeemeth a very ſtraunge and a monſtrous maner of ſpeaking thus to ſay: I liue, I liue not: I am dead, I am not dead: I am a ſinner, I am not a ſinner: I haue the law, I haue not the law. Which phraſe is ſweete and comfortable to all thoſe that beleue in Chriſt. For in that they behold themſelues,<note place="margin">Albeit the faithfull be ſinners yet are they alſo righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</note> they haue both the law and ſinne: but in that they looke vnto Chriſt, they are dead to the law and haue no ſinne. If then in the matter of iuſtification thou ſeparate the perſon of Chriſt from thy perſon, then art thou in the law, thou abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in the law, thou liueſt in the law and not in Chriſt, and ſo thou art condemned of the law and dead before God.<note place="margin">The Papiſtes faith.</note> For thou haſt that faith which (as the Sophiſters dreame) is furniſhed with charitie. Thus I ſpeake for examples ſake. For there was neuer any one found that was ſaued by this faith. And therfore what things ſoeuer the Sophiſters haue written touching this faith, are nothing els but vaine toyes and meere deceites of Sathan. But let vs graunt that ſuch there be as haue this faith: yet are they not therfore iuſtified. For they haue but an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall Faith concerning Chriſt, which the Deuill alſo and all the wicked haue.</p>
                  <p>Faith therfore muſt be purely taught: namely that thou art ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and nerely ioyned vnto Chriſt,<note place="margin">Faith ſo knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers &amp; Chriſt together, that they become one perſon.</note> that he and thou are made as it were one perſon, ſo that thou maieſt boldly ſay, I am now one with Chriſt, that is to ſay, Chriſtes righteouſnes, victory, and life are mine. And again, Chriſt may ſay, I am that ſinner, that is, his ſinnes and his death are mine becauſe he is vnited and ioyned vnto me &amp; I vnto him. For by faith we are ſo ioyned together that we are become one fleſh &amp; one bone. <hi>Eph. 5.</hi> we are the members of the body of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.30.</note> fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bones: So that this faith doth couple Chriſt and me more neare together then the huſband is coupled to his wife.<note place="margin">True faith is not idle.</note> This faith therfore is not an idle qualitie, but the excellencie therof is ſuch, that it vtterly confoundeth theſe fooliſh dreames of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sophiſters tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their formed faith and counterfeit charitie, their merits, workes and worthines. Theſe things I would gladly ſet forth more amply if
<pb facs="tcp:9456:87"/>
by any meanes I could.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we haue declared this to be the firſt argument of <hi>Paule:</hi> that either Chriſt muſt needes be the miniſter of ſinne, or els the lawe doth not iuſtifie: when he had finiſhed this argument, he ſet forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for an example, ſaying: that he was dead vnto that old law by a certaine new law. Now he aunſwereth two obiections which might be made againſt him. His firſt aunſwere is againſt the cauillations of the proude, and the offence of the weake. For when remiſſion of ſinnes is freely preached, then doe the malicious by and by ſclander this prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. As <hi>Rom, 3: <hi>Let vs doe euill that good may come therof.</hi>
                     </hi> For theſe fellowes as ſoone as they heare that we are not iuſtified by the law,<note place="margin">VVhat occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous take of this doctrine.</note> forthwith do maliciouſly conclude and ſay: why, then let vs reiect the law. Againe, if grace doe there abound (ſay they) where ſinne doth abound, let vs then abound in ſinne that we may become righteous, and that grace may the more abound. Theſe are the malicious and proude ſpirites, which ſpitefully and wittingly ſclaunder the ſcriptures &amp; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the holy Ghoſt, euen as they ſclaundered <hi>Paule</hi> whileſt the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles liued, to their owne confuſion &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation, as it is ſaid. <hi>2. Pet. 3.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Hovv the vveake are to be inſtructed.</note>Moreouer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> weake which are not malicious, are offended when they heare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the law &amp; good works are not to be done as neceſſary to iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Theſe muſt be holpen, and muſt be inſtructed how good works doe not iuſtifie:<note place="margin">Good vvorks are not the cauſe but the frutes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes.</note> how they ought to be done, how not to be done. They ought to be done, not as the cauſe, but as the frutes of righteouſnes: and when we are made righteous we ought to doe them: but not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, to the end that when we are vnrighteous we may be made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. The tree maketh the apple, but not the apple the tree.</p>
                  <p>He ſaid before: <hi>I am dead. &amp;c.</hi> here the preſumptious and malicious might ſoone take occaſion to cauill after this maner. What ſaieſt thou <hi>Paule?</hi> art thou dead? how then doeſt thou ſpeake? how doeſt thou write? The weake alſo might ſoone be offended and ſay vnto him: what art thou <hi>Paule?</hi> Doe we not ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou art liuing, and doeſt ſuch things as pertaine to this life?<note place="margin">Life taken tvvo maner of vvaies.</note> To this he aunſwereth: I liue in deede, and yet now not I, but Chriſt liueth in me. Ther is then a double life. The firſt is mine, which is naturall: the ſecond is the life of an other, that is to ſay, the life of Chriſt in me. As touching my natural life I am dead, and now I liue an other life. I liue not now as <hi>Paule,</hi> but <hi>Paule</hi> is deade. Who is it then that liueth? The Chriſtian. <hi>Paule</hi> therfore as he liueth in him ſelfe, is wholy dead through the law: but as he liueth in Chriſt, or rather as Chriſt liueth in him, he liueth by an other life: for Chriſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9456:87"/>
ſpeaketh in hin, liueth in him, and exerciſeth all the operations of life in him. This cometh not now of the life of <hi>Paule,</hi> but of the life of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and regenerate perſon. Therfore thou malicious ſpirite, where I ſay that I am dead, now ſclaunder my words no more. And thou y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> art weake, be not offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, but diſtinguiſh &amp; diuide this matter rightly. For (as I ſaide) there are two liues: to wit, my naturall life, and the life of an other. By mine owne life I liue not: for it I did,<note place="margin">The faithfull liue not their ovvne life, but the life of Chriſt.</note> the law would haue dominion ouer me, and hold me in captiuitie. To the end therfore that it ſhould not hold me in captiuitie &amp; bondage, I am dead to it by an other law: and this death purchaſeth vnto me the life of an other, euen the life of Chriſt: which life is not mine by nature, but is geuen vnto me by Chriſt through faith.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond aunſwere is this. It might againe be obiected vnto <hi>Paule:</hi> what ſaieſt thou <hi>Paule?</hi> Doeſt thou not liue by thine owne life, or in thine owne fleſh, but in Chriſt? we ſee thy fleſh, but we ſee not Chriſt. Wouldeſt thou then delude vs by thine inchauntments, that we ſhould not ſee thee preſent in fleſh, liuing as thou diddeſt before, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things in this corporall life as others doe? he aunſwereth.</p>

Ghoſt and of Chriſt. This ſight which goeth in or cometh out at mine eies procedeth not of fleſh, that is to ſay, it is not gouerned of the fleſh, but of the holy Ghoſt. So my hearing cometh not of the fleſh, although it be in the fleſh, but of the holy Ghoſt. A Chriſtian ſpeaketh none other but chaſt, ſober, &amp; holy things, which pertaine vnto Chriſt, to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God &amp; the profit of his neighbour. Theſe things come not of the fleſh, neither are done accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the fleſh, and yet are they in the fleſh. For I can not teach, write, pray or geue thanks but with theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the fleſh, which are neceſſary to the accompliſhing of theſe works: and yet notwithſtanding theſe works proceede not of the fleſh, but are geuen by God from aboue. In like maner I behold a woman, but with a chaſt eie, not luſting after her. This beholding cometh not of the fleſh, although it be in the fleſh becauſe the eies are the carnall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of this ſight: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chaſtnes of this ſight cometh from heauen.</p>
                  <p>Thus a Chriſtian vſeth the world and all creatures, ſo that there is no difference betwene him and the Infidell. For in their apparell, in their feeding, hearing, ſeing, ſpeaking, geſtures, cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenances and ſuch other things they are like, and in outward apperance they ſeeme to be all one (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Philip. 2.7.</note>

But his voice and his toung were then blaſphemous, and therfore he could ſpeake nothing els but blaſphemies &amp; abhominations againſt Chriſt and his Church. After he was conuerted he had the ſame fleſh, the ſame voice and toung which he had before, and nothing was chaunged: but his voice and his toung then vttered no blaſphemies but ſpirituall and heauenly words: to witte, thanks geuing and the praiſe of God: which came of faith &amp; the holy Ghoſt. So then I liue in the fleſh, but not of the fleſh or after the fleſh, but in the faith of the ſonne of God.</p>
                  <p>Hereby we may plainly ſee whence this ſpirituall life cometh: which we haue not of our ſelues but of an other, which the natural man can in no wiſe vnderſtand, for he knoweth not what maner of life this is. He heareth the wind, but whence it cometh or whither it goeth he knoweth not. He heareth the voice of the ſpirituall man, he knoweth his face, his maners and his geſtures: but he ſeeth not whence theſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9456:88"/>
workes, which are not now wicked and blaſphemous as before, but holy and godly: or whence theſe motions and actions doe come. For this life is in the heart by Faith, where the fleſh is killed and Chriſt raigneth with his holy ſpirite, who now ſeeth, heareth, ſpeaketh, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, ſuffereth and doth all other things in him, although the fleſh doe reſiſt.

But we muſt diligently wey and conſider theſe wordes: <hi>The ſonne of God hath loued me, and geuen him ſelfe for me.</hi> It was not I then that firſt loued the ſonne of God, and deliuered my ſelfe for him: as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters dreame, that they loue the ſonne of God and deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for him. For they teach that a man <hi>expuris naturalibus,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">The peſtilent doctrine of the Papiſtes and Pelagia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> of his owne pure naturall ſtrength, can do meritorious works before grace, &amp; loue God &amp; Chriſt aboue all things. Theſe felowes preuent the loue of God and Chriſt: for they doe that which lieth in them (as they are wont to ſay) that is, they doe not onely kepe the commaundements, but they doe alſo the workes of ſupererogation, &amp; ſell the ouerplus of their merites to laimen, &amp; ſo (as they imagine) they deliuer them ſelues for Chriſtes ſake, whereby they ſaue both themſelues &amp; others, turning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of <hi>Paule</hi> cleane contrary, and ſaying:<note place="margin">Theſe merite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers turne theſe vvordes of Paule vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide dovvne.</note> we haue loued Chriſt and geuen our ſelues for him.

They confeſſe in wordes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is a iuſtifier and a Sauiour: but in very deede they take from him the power both to iuſtifie and ſaue, and geue the ſame to their owne wilworkes, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and deuotions. This is to liue in their owne righteouſnes and workes, and not in the faith of the ſonne of God.</p>
                  <p>This is not then the true meanes to attaine iuſtification, to do that
<pb facs="tcp:9456:89"/>
which in thee lieth:<note place="margin">To doe vvhat in vs lieth.</note> as the Sophiſters and Scholedoctours doe teache, which affirme that if a man do what in him lieth, God wil vndoubtedly geue vnto him his grace. But this ſaying may not be ſtraitly vrged, ſay they. For if we doe thoſe works which may be approued by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any good man, it is enough: for then grace ſhall ſurely follow, becauſe god, in that he is good and iuſt, muſt needes geue grace as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for ſuch good works. And hereof cometh this verſe:
<q>

                           <hi>Vitra poſſe viri non vult Deus vlla requiri.</hi> That is,</l>

                     </note> to the which alſo theſe ſayings doe pertaine: To doe what in vs lieth: To doe as much as we are able. But the Sophiſters apply theſe ſayings to the ſpirituall kingdome, wherin a man can do nothing els but ſinne: for he <hi>is ſold vnder ſinne.</hi> But in externall things (ſuch I meane as pertaine to ciuill and houſhould gouernment) he is not a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, but a Lord and a ruler.

                  <p>Moreouer, they ſay that nature is corrupt, but the qualities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture notwithſtanding are ſound and vncorrupt: which alſo they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute euen vnto Deuils. Vpon this grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they reaſon after this maner.

To knowe theſe things it is neceſſary for you, that ye may hold the ſinceritie of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of faith. Where they ſay then that the naturall qualities of man are ſound and vncorrupt, and therof do inferre, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is able of him ſelfe to fulfil the law, and to loue God with al his heart, applying theſe qualities to the ſpirituall kingdome, I deny the conſequence. And here I make a diſtinction betwene the naturall and the ſpirituall qualities (which they confound and mingle together), &amp; I ſay that the ſpirituall qualities are not ſound but corrupt, yea vtterly quenched through ſinne both in man and deuill, ſo that there is in them nothing els but corrupt vnderſtanding and a will continually ſtriuing againſt the will of God, which can thinke nothing els but that which is altogether againſt god.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:9456:89"/>
Notwithſtanding, I graunt that the naturall qualities are vncorrupt. But what qualities are they? That a man being drowned in ſinne and iniquitie, and a bondſlaue of Satan, hath will, reaſon, and power not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to execute the office of a magiſtrate, to gouerne a family, to guide a ſhippe, to build a houſe, and to doe ſuch other things as are ſubiect vnto man: for theſe things are not taken from him. We doe not then denie but that theſe ſentences are true in the corporall kingdom: But if ye wreſt them to the ſpirituall kingdom, I vtterly deny them: for there (as I ſaid) we are cleane ouerwhelmed and drowned in ſinne. Whatſoeuer is in our wil, is euil: whatſoeuer is in our vnderſtanding, is errour.

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore I ſay (as I haue often times ſaid) that there is no remedie againſt Sectes or power to reſiſt them, but this onely article of Chriſtian righteouſnes. If we loſe this article, it is impoſſible for vs to withſtand any errours or Sectes: As we may ſee at this daye in the phanaticall ſpirites the Anabaptiſtes and ſuch like:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:9456:90"/>
who being fallen away from this article of iuſtification, will neuer ceaſe to fall, erre, and ſeduce vntill they come to the fulnes of all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. There is no dout, but they will raiſe vp innumerable ſectes, and ſtill deuiſe new workes. But what are al theſe things (though they haue neuer ſo goodly a ſhew of holines) if ye compare them to the death and bloud of the ſonne of God, <hi>vvho gaue himſelfe for me.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well, I pray you, who this ſonne of God is, how glorious he is, how mightie he is. What is heauen and earth in compariſon of him? Let all the Papiſtes and all the authors of ſectes, yea though the whole world take their part, be throwne downe into hell, withall their righteouſnes, workes, and merits, rather then the truth of the Goſpell ſhould be blemiſhed, and the glory of Chriſt periſh. What meane they they then, to bragge ſo much of workes and merits? If I being a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and a damned ſinner could be redemed by any other price, what needed the ſonne of God to be geuen for me? But becauſe there was no other price, either in heauen or in earth, but Chriſt the ſonne of God, therefore it was moſt neceſſary y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould be deliuered for me. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer this he did of ineſtimable loue: For <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth, <hi>vvhich loued me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherfore theſe wordes: <hi>vvhich loued me,</hi> are full of faith.<note place="margin">Hath geuen himſelfe for me.</note> And he that can vtter this litle word <hi>Me,</hi> and apply it vnto him ſelfe with a true and conſtant faith as <hi>Paule</hi> did, ſhalbe a good diſputer with <hi>Paule</hi> againſt the lawe. For he deliuered neither ſhepe, oxe, golde nor ſiluer, but euen God him ſelfe entierly and wholy, <hi>for me,</hi> euen for me (I ſay) a miſerable and wretched ſinner. Nowe therefore in that the ſonne of God was thus deliuered to death for me, I take comfort and applie this benefite vnto my ſelfe.<note place="margin">The true force of faith.</note> And this maner of applying is the right force of faith in deede.</p>
                  <p>Theſe wordes (which are the pure preaching of grace and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian righteouſnes in deede) <hi>Paule</hi> ſetteth againſt the righteouſnes of the law.

But I haue now an other which hath deliuered me from the terrours of the law, ſinne and death, and hath brought me vnto libertie, the righteouſnes of God, and eternall life: who is called the ſonne of God: to whom be praiſe and glory for euermore.</p>
                  <p>Faith therefore (as I haue ſaid) embraceth and wrappeth in it ſelfe Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of God, deliuered to death for vs, as <hi>Paule</hi> here teacheth, who being apprehended by faith, geueth vnto vs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
<pb facs="tcp:9456:91"/>
and life. And here he ſetteth out moſt liuely the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode and offices of Chriſt: which are to pacifie God, to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ſinners, to offer vppe him ſelfe a ſacrifice for their ſinnes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme, to inſtruct, and to comfort them. Let vs learne therefore to geue a true definition of Chriſt, not as the Scholedoctours do and ſuch as ſeeke righteouſnes by their owne workes, which make him a new law-geuer, who aboliſhing the olde lawe hath eſtabliſhed a newe. To theſe Chriſt is nothing elſe but an exactor and a tyranne:<note place="margin">A true defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt.</note> but let vs define him as <hi>Paule</hi> here doth: namely that he is the ſonne of God, who not for our deſert or any righteouſnes of ours, but of his owne free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie offered vppe him ſelfe a ſacrifice for vs ſinners, that he might ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie vs for euer.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt then is no <hi>Moſes,</hi> no exactor, no geuer of lawes, but a geuer of grace, a Sauiour, and one that is full of mercie: briefly, he is nothing elſe but infinite mercie and goodnes, freely geuen and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully geuing vnto vs. And thus ſhall you paint out Chriſt in his right coloures. If you ſuffer him to be painted out to you any otherwiſe then thus, when tentation and trouble cometh you ſhall ſoone be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.<note place="margin">The greateſt cunning that Chriſtians can haue, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Chriſt rightly.</note> Nowe, as it is the greateſt knowledge and cunning that Chriſtians ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue, thus to define Chriſt: ſo of all things it is the moſt hardeſt. For I my ſelfe euen in this great light of the Goſpell, wherein I haue bene ſo long exerciſed, haue much a doe to hold this definition of Chriſt which <hi>Paule</hi> here geueth: So depely hath this doctrine and peſtilent opinion that Chriſt is a lawgeuer, entred in me, euen as it were oyle into my boanes. Ye yong men therefore are in this caſe much more happie then we that are olde. For ye are not infected with theſe pernicious errours, wherein I haue bene ſo nuſled and ſo drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euen from my youth, that at the very hearing of the name of Chriſt my heart hath tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled and quaked for feare: for I was perſwaded that he was a ſeuere iudge. Wherefore it is to me a double trauaile &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to correct and reforme this euill: Firſt to forget, to condemne, and to withſtand this olde grounded errour, that Chriſt is a lawgeuer and a Iudge: for it often returneth and plucketh me backe. Then to plant in my heart a new &amp; a true perſwaſion of Chriſt, that he is a iuſtifier &amp; a Sauiour. Ye (I ſay) that are yong, may learne with much leſſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to know Chriſt purely and ſincerely if ye will. Wherfore if any man feele him ſelfe oppreſſed with heauines and anguiſh of heart, he muſt not impute it vnto Chriſt, although it come vnder the name of Chriſt, but vnto the Deuill, who oftentimes cometh vnder the colour
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9456:91"/>
of Chriſt, and tranſformeth himſelfe into an Angell of light.</p>
                  <p>Let vs learne therefore to put a difference betwene Chriſt and a lawgeuer, not only in word but in practiſe, &amp; in deede alſo, that when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Deuil ſhal come vnder the ſhadow of Chriſt, &amp; ſhal go about to trouble vs vnder his name, we may know him, not to be Chriſt, but a very feend in deede. For Chriſt when he cometh, is nothing elſe but ioy and ſweetenes to a trembling and broken heart, as here <hi>Paule</hi> witneſſeth, who ſetteth him out with this moſt ſweete &amp; louing title when he ſaith: <hi>vvhich loued me and gaue him ſelfe for me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt loueth the afflicted, and ſuch as feele the vveight of their ſinnes.</note> Chriſt therefore in very deede is a louer of thoſe which are in bitternes of minde, ſinne &amp; death, and ſuch a louer as gaue him ſelfe for them: who is alſo our high prieſt, that is to ſay, a mediatour betwene God &amp; vs wretched ſinners. What could be ſayd (I pray you) more ſweete or comfortable to the poore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted conſcience? Now, if theſe things be true (as they are in deede moſt true, or elſe the Goſpell muſt be nothing elſe but a fable) then are we not iuſtified by the righteouſnes of the lawe: and much leſſe by our owne righteouſnes.</p>
                  <p>Read therefore with diligent attention, and with great vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie theſe wordes <hi>Me</hi> and <hi>for me,</hi> and ſo practiſe with thy ſelfe,<note place="margin">Me. For me.</note> that thou maiſt well conceaue and print this <hi>Me</hi> in thy heart, and applie it vnto thy ſelfe with a ſtedfaſt faith, not doubting but thou art of the number of thoſe to whom this <hi>Me</hi> belongeth: Alſo that Chriſt hath not onely loued <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule,</hi> and geuen him ſelfe for them, but that the ſame grace alſo which is comprehended in this <hi>Me,</hi> doth as well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and extend vnto vs as vnto them. For as we can not denie but that we are all ſinners, and are conſtrained to ſay that through the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> we were all loſt, were made the enemies of God, ſubiect to the wrath and iudgement of God, and giltie of eternall death (for this doe all terrified heartes feele and confeſſe, and more in deede then they ſhould do) ſo can we not denie but that Chriſt died for our ſinnes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might make vs righteous. For he died not to iuſtifie the righteous, but the vnrighteous, and to make them the children of God, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritours of all ſpirituall &amp; heauenly gifts. Therfore when I feele &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſelfe to be a ſinner through <hi>Adams</hi> tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſion,<note place="margin">As by Adam all became giltie, ſo by Chriſt all that beleue, are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> why ſhould I not ſay that I am made righteous through the righteouſnes of Chriſt, eſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I heare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he loued me, &amp; gaue himſelfe for me. This did <hi>Paule</hi> moſt ſtedfaſtly beleue, &amp; therfore he ſpeaketh theſe wordes with ſo great a vehemencie and full aſſurance. Which he graunt vnto vs, in ſome part at the leaſt, who hath loiſed vs and geuen him ſelfe for vs.</p>

                  <p>Now he prepareth a way to the ſecond argument of this epiſtle.

But, I pray you, what ſinne ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be more execrable or horrible then to reiect the grace of God and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe that righteouſnes which cometh by Chriſt? It is enough and to much already that we are wicked ſinners and tranſgreſſours of all the commaundements of God: and yet we commit moreouer the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable ſinne of all ſinnes, in that we doe ſo contemptuouſly refuſe the grace of God and remiſſion of ſinnes offered vnto vs by Chriſt. This blaſphemy is more horrible then can be expreſſed. There is no ſinne which <hi>Paule</hi> and the other Apoſtles did ſo much deteſt as the contempt of grace and deniall of Chriſt, and yet there is no ſinne more common. Hereof it cometh that <hi>Paule</hi> aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt doth ſo ſharply inuey againſt Antichriſt for that he deſpiſeth the grace of God and refuſeth the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of Chriſt our high Prieſt,<note place="margin">Antichriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth grace, and denieth faith.</note> who offered vp himſelfe a ſacrifice for our ſinnes. Now thus to deny Chriſt, what is it els but to ſpitte in his face, to treade him vnder foote, to ſet himſelfe in his place, and to ſay: I will iuſtifie thee and will ſaue thee. By what meanes? By maſſes, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, pardons, merits and ſuch like. We ſee then how proudly Antichriſt hath lift vp himſelfe againſt and aboue God, and ſet himſelf in the place of Chriſt, reiected the grace of God and denied the faith. For this is his doctrine: Faith auaileth nothing (ſaith he) vnleſſe it be ioyned with works: and by this falſe and deteſtable doctrine he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, darkned, and vtterly buried the benefite of Chriſt, &amp; in the ſteede of the grace of Chriſt and his kingdome, he hath eſtabliſhed the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of works and the kingdome of ceremonies, and hath confirmed the ſame with meere trifles and doting dreames, and by this meanes he hath wreſted the whole world out of Chriſtes hands (who alone ought to reigne in the conſcience) &amp; hath throwne it downe hedlong into hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">VVhat it is to reiect grace.</note>Hereby we may eaſily vnderſtand what it is to reiect and refuſe the grace of God, euen to ſeeke righteouſnes by the law. Now, who hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard that a man by keping of the law reiecteth grace? Do we then ſinne in keeping of the law? No forſoth. But we deſpiſe grace when we obſerue the law to this end, that we may be iuſtified through it. The law is good, holy and profitable, and yet it iuſtifieth not. He then that kepeth the law to be iuſtified therby, reiecteth grace, denieth Chriſt,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9456:92"/>
deſpiſeth his ſacrifice, and will not be ſaued by this ineſtimable price, but will ſatiſfie for his ſinnes through the righteouſnes of the law, or deſerue grace by his owne righteouſnes: and this man blaſphemeth and deſpiſeth the grace of God. Now what an horrible thing is it to ſay that any man ſhould be ſo deuiliſh, as to deſpiſe the grace and mercy of God?

                  <p>Here againe I admoniſh you that <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh not of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall law onely (for this the Papiſtes doe alwaies alleage) but of the whole law.<note place="margin">Corrupters of Paule.</note> And theſe words of <hi>Paule</hi> are diligently to be conſidered in this wiſe.

                  <p>Take now therfore the whole law, and imagine that by the merite of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gruence or works going before grace, thou haſt ſo much profited, that thou haſt receaued grace and the ſpirite of God, which is a thinge impoſſible vnto nature:<note place="margin">If the deſert of congruence auaile ought, then is Chriſt dead in vaine.</note> but yet admitte (I ſay) that in doing what in thee lieth, thou haſt obtained grace, art made righteous, and haſt recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the holy Ghoſt by the merite of congruence: then haſt thou no neede of Chriſt, he is to thee vnprofitable and his death of none effect.</p>

For in that he doth what in him lieth, he deſerueth grace, &amp; the holy Ghoſt is powred into him, wherby he is now able to loue God and his neighbour. This being graunted, it muſt needes follow that Chriſt died in vaine. For what neede of Chriſt hath he which both loueth Chriſt and geueth himſelfe for him, ſo that he is able by the merite of congruence before grace to obtaine grace, and then to doe ſuch works as by the merite of

                     <note place="margin">A common ſinne to reiect the grace of God.</note>Wherfore, to reiect the grace of God, is an horrible ſinne and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reigning throughout the world: wherof al they are giltie which ſeeke righteouſnes by their owne workes. For whiles they ſeeke to be iuſtified by their owne works and merites or by the law, they reiect the grace of God and Chriſt,<note place="margin">The Pope the chiefe author of all abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in the church.</note> as I haue ſaid. And of all theſe abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Pope hath bene the only author.

And hereof amongeſt other enormities,<note place="margin">The Popes pardons.</note> his bulles and pardons are a ſufficient witnes: wherby he abſolueth, not ſuch as beleue, but ſuch as are contrite, make confeſſion to a Prieſt, and reach out their helping hand to the maintenance of his pompe and his traditions. Yet notwithſtanding in this greate light of the Goſpell the blind and obſtinate Papiſtes doe continue ſtill in their damnable doting dreames, ſaying that the qualities of nature doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſound and vncorrupt, &amp; that men are able to prepare themſelues to grace, or to deſerue grace by their owne works and merits. And ſo farre of is it that they will acknowledge their errour and impietie, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9456:93"/>
they doe yet ſtill obſtinatly defend the ſame euen againſt their owne conſcience.</p>
                  <p>But we doe conſtantly affirme with <hi>Paule</hi> (for we will not reiect the grace of God) that either Chriſt died in vaine,<note place="margin">If the lavv iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, then is Chriſt died in vaine.</note> or els the law iuſtifieth not. But Chriſt died not in vaine: therfore the law iuſtifieth not. Chriſt the ſonne of God of his owne free grace and mercy hath iuſtified vs: therfore the law could not iuſtifie vs: for if it could, then had Chriſt done vnwiſely in that he gaue himſelfe for our ſinnes that we therby might be iuſtified. We conclude therfore that we are iuſtified neither by our owne works and merites before grace or after, neither yet by the law.</p>
                  <p>Now, if my ſaluation was ſo coſtly and deare a price vnto Chriſt, that he was conſtrained to die for my ſinnes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all my works, with all the righteouſnes of the law,<note place="margin">A comparing of Chriſt and the lavv toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> are but vile and nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g worth in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this ineſtimable price. For how can I bie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for a farthing which coſt many thouſand talents of gold? Now the law (to ſpeake nothing of other matters which are of much leſſe valew) with all the works and righteouſnes therof, is but as a farthing if ye compare it vnto Chriſt: who by his death hath vanquiſhed my death and hath purchaſed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and euerlaſting life. Should I then deſpiſe and reiect this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable price, and by the law or by the works and merites of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (vile droſſe and dung, for ſo <hi>Paule</hi> calleth them, if they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt) ſeeke that righteouſnes which Chriſt freely &amp; of meere loue hath geuen vnto me already, &amp; hath coſt him ſo greate a price that he was conſtrained to geue himſelfe and euen his owne hart bloud for me? This (as I haue ſaid) the whole world doth, and ſpecially ſuch as will be counted more holy and religious then others. Wherby they plainly witnes that Chriſt died in vaine,<note place="margin">The deuilish peruerſnes of the vvorld.</note> although with their mouthes they confeſſe the contrary neuer ſo much. Which is moſt horribly to blaſphemie the ſonne of god, to ſpit in his face, to tread him vnder foote, to count the bloud of the teſtament as an vnholy thing, &amp; vtterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the ſpirite of grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> here diſputing of righteouſnes, hath no ciuill matter in hand, that is, he ſpeaketh not of ciuill righteouſnes: which God notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alloweth and requireth,<note place="margin">Ciuill righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes hath her revvards.</note> and geueth certaine rewards therunto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: which alſo reaſon is able in ſome part to performe.

                  <p>The lawe is geuen beſides and aboue reaſon to be a light &amp; a helpe to man, and to ſhew him what he ought to doe, &amp; what to leaue vndone.

Now, if that which is the moſt excellent thing in the world (the law I ſay) which as a bright ſhining ſunne is ioyned to the dimme and obſcure light of mans reaſon, to lighten and to direct it, is not able to iuſtifie, what can reaſon doe (I pray you) without the lawe? What? Doutles nothing elſe but that which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope with his dreaming So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters and his whole Sinagoge hath done, who with their owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions haue darkned the light euen of the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is not one of them that is able rightly to vnderſtand any one ſyllable of the lawe, but euery man walketh in mere darknes of mans reaſon. And this errour is much more pernicious and deadly then that which procedeth of the doctrine of workes and the lawe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words therfore are very effectuall and full of power, where he ſayth:<note place="margin">Galath. 2.21.</note> 
                     <hi>If righteouſnes come by the lavv, then Chriſt died in vaine.</hi> He ſpeaketh here nothing of mans ſtrength, reaſon or wiſedom, be it neuer ſo great (for the greater it is, the ſooner it deceaueth a man), but he ſayth plainly without all condition: <hi>If by the lavv. &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore reaſon lightned, aided, and directed by the lawe, yea euen by the law of God, is ſo vnable to attaine righteouſnes, that it draweth a man from righteouſnes &amp; reiecteth Chriſt. Set thou therfore the death of Chriſt ſimplie againſt all lawes, and with <hi>Paule</hi> know nothing but Ieſus Chriſt crucified. Receaue no light either of reaſon, or of the lawe, or of any thing elſe then of Chriſt alone. Then ſhalt thou be learned in dede, righteous and holy, and ſhalt receaue the holy Ghoſt, which ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue thee in the puritie of the word and faith: but ſet Chriſt aſide, and all things are but vnprofitable and vaine what ſo euer they be.</p>
                  <p>Here againe we ſee what a goodly commendation <hi>Paule</hi> geueth to the righteouſnes of the lawe, or mans owne righteouſnes, in that he teacheth it to be a contempt and reiecting of the grace of God, and an aboliſhing of the death of Chriſt.<note place="margin">The praiſe of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of the lavve.</note> 
                     <hi>Paule</hi> is no great Rhetorician, and yet ſee what matter he miniſtreth to him that liſteth to play the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rician.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9456:94"/>
whereof is ſuch, that all the eloquence in the world is not able to comprehend it. To ſay that any man dieth in vaine, it is but a ſmall mater: but to ſay that Chriſt died in vaine, it is to take him quite away and make of him nothing at all. Who ſo liſteth to play the Rhetorician hath here mater enough to dilate and amplifie at large, what an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible &amp; blaſphemous doctrine it is to ſet vp the righteouſnes of the law and workes. For what can be more blaſphemous and horrible, then to make the death of Chriſt vnprofitable?<note place="margin">VVho make Chriſt to haue died in vaine.</note> and what doe they els which obſerue the law to the end they may be iuſtified therby? Now, to make the death of Chriſt vnprofitable, is alſo to make his reſurrection, his victory, his glory, his kingdome, heauen, earth, God himſelfe, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of God, and briefly all things els whatſoeuer, but vnprofitable and of none effect.</p>
                  <p>This thundring and lightning from heauen againſt the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the law and mans owne righteouſnes, ſhould feare vs and make vs to abhorre it.

For who will not deteſt his owne vowes, his cowle, his ſhauen croune, all mens traditions, yea the very law of <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, if he heare that for theſe things he reiecteth the grace of god and maketh the death of Chriſt vnprofitable? The world hearing this, doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue that it is true. It thinketh that ſuch horrible wickednes can not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any mans heart, that he ſhould reiect the grace of God &amp; eſteme the death of Chriſt as a thing of nought. And yet this ſinne commonly reigneth. For whoſoeuer ſeeketh righteouſnes without Chriſt, either by workes, merites, ſatiſfactions, afflictions, or by the law, reiecteth the grace of God and deſpiſeth the death of Chriſt, whatſoeuer he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth with his mouth to the contrary.</p>

                  <p>Now, after that he hath ſufficiently proued, and with two ſtrong arguments confirmed this article, that Chriſtian righteouſnes cometh not by keeping of the law, but by faith in Chriſt, and withall hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed the doctrine of the falſe Apoſtles: in the middes of this diſcourſe he turneth his talke to the <hi>Galathians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">O ye foolish Galathians.</note> and reproueth them, ſaying: <hi>O ye foolish Galathians. &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay: Alas, from whence are ye falne, O ye miſerable <hi>Galathians?</hi> I haue moſt carefully and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently taught you the truth of the Goſpell, and ye alſo haue receaued the ſame of me with feruent zeale and greate diligence. How then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to paſſe, that ye are ſo ſuddainly falne away from it? who hath bewitched you?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Paule offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in chiding the Galathians ſo sharply.</note>He rebuketh the <hi>Galathians</hi> very ſharply (as it ſeemeth) when he calleth them fooles, bewitched, and diſobedient to the truth. Now, whether he did this of zeale or compaſſion, I will not here contend: both may be true. A carnall man would interprete this to be a reuiling rather then a godly reprehenſion. Did <hi>Paule</hi> then geue an euill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or was he ſpitefull againſt the churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> becauſe he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them fooliſh and bewitched? No, not ſo. For with a Chriſtian zeale it is lawfull for an Apoſtle, paſtour, or preacher ſharply to reproue the people committed to his charge:<note place="margin">The chiding of parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards their children.</note> and ſuch reprouings are both father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; godly. So parents, of a fatherly and motherly affection, do ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproue and rebuke their children: which they would not beare if an other ſhould doe it. The Scholemaſter ſometimes is angry with his ſcholler: he rebuketh him and beateth him with roddes: all which he taketh in good parte and would not beare it at the handes of his equall. The magiſtrate likewiſe is angry: he reproueth and puniſheth ſuch as are vnder his charge. And this diſcipline is not onely good, but alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſary:<note place="margin">Anger ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary vertue.</note> without the which nothing can be well done. Wherfore vnleſſe the magiſtrate, the miniſter, the father and mother be angry and vſe to reproue or rebuke when caſe requireth, he is vnprofitable, and neuer ſhall diſcharge his office rightly.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore ſharpe chidings &amp; bitter words are as neceſſary in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind of life, as any other vertue els. Yet notwithſtanding this anger muſt be ſo tempered, that it procede not of any enuy or malice, but
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9456:95"/>
onely of a fatherly affection and Chriſtian zeale: that is to ſay, it ought not to be childiſh or womanlike, ſeking reuenge: but onely for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of the faulte: As the father correcteth not his childe with deſire to reuenge, but only that the childe therby may be the better.<note place="margin">Iuſt anger is called in the ſcripture zeale or ielouſie.</note> And theſe kindes of anger are good, and are called in the ſcripture ielouſies or zeales. For in chaſtiſing my brother, my child, my ſcholler or ſubiect in this ſort, I ſeeke not his deſtruction, but his profite and welfare.</p>
                  <p>It may be then that <hi>Paule</hi> here rebuketh the <hi>Galathians,</hi> either of a very zeale (not to deſtroy them, but by this meanes to reduce them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way againe and to amend them): or els of pitie and compaſſion, as it were by way of complaint, for that it greueth him that the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> ſhould be ſo miſerably ſeduced. As if he ſhould ſay: I am ſory and aſhamed to heare of this your miſerable caſe, your wretched do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp;c. In like maner doe we alſo reproue the miſerable: not that we treade them downe, or vpbraide them with their miſery, but as hauing compaſſion on them and ſeeking their amendment. This I ſay, leſt any man ſhould cauill that <hi>Paule</hi> railed vpon the churches, contrary to the rule of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>In like maner Chriſt rebuketh the phariſeis, calling them <hi>ſerpents,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math. 13 33.</hi> The sharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukings of the holy Ghoſt.</note> 
                     <hi>the generation of vipers, the children of the deuil.</hi> But theſe are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukings of the holy Ghoſt. They are fatherly and motherly, and as the chidings of a faithfull frend: As it is ſaid alſo in the prouerbes: <hi>Better are the vvoundes of a frend then the kiſſes of an enemy.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prouerb. 27.6.</note> Thus one and the ſelfe ſame rebuke, if it come out of the mouth of a father, may be a great benefite: but if it procede out of the mouth of our equall or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, it is a ſpitefull reproch. When two men doe both one thing, in the one it is commendable, and in the other it is cleane contrary. When Chriſt and <hi>Paule</hi> doe reproue, it is done with ſingular vertue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation: but when a priuate man ſhall doe the like, in him it is a greate vice. Therfore one and the ſelfe ſame word in the mouth of <hi>Paule</hi> is a great vertue and a ſingular benefite: but in the mouth of an other it is a ſhamefull reproch.</p>
                  <p>Here is a great vehemencie to be noted in this word <hi>Galathians.</hi> For he calleth them not brethren, as els where he is wont to doe:<note place="margin">The naturall vice of the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians.</note> but he calleth them by the name of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. And it ſhould ſeeme that it was the naturall vice of that nation to be fooliſh: like as it was the fault of the <hi>Cretenſes</hi> to be liars. As if he ſhould ſay: As ye are called, euen ſo are ye in deed and ſo ye continue, that is to ſay, fooliſh <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians:</hi> and this ye proue euen now in this buſines of the Goſpell (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:9456:96"/>
notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ye ought to haue ſhewed your ſelues moſt wiſe), but ye continue ſtill in your old nature and ſhew your ſelues no change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. Thus <hi>Paule</hi> by way of correction putteth them in mind of their corrupt nature.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, we are here admoniſhed, that according to the fleſh there are yet certaine naturall vices remaining euen in Chriſtian churches.<note place="margin">The remnants of naturall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces remaine in the Godly.</note> Grace maketh not ſuch a chaung in the faithfull, that by and by they become altogether new creatures and perfect in all things: but there remaine yet certaine dregges of their old and naturall corruption. As if a man that is naturally enclined to anger be conuerted to Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be mollified by grace (the holy Ghoſt ſo framing his heart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is now become more meeke and gentile) yet this naturall vice is not vtterly quenched in his fleſh. Likewiſe, ſuch as are by nature ſtubborne and ſtout harted men,<note place="margin">Ebr. 12.</note> although they be conuerted to the faith, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they can not vtterly forſake this ſtubbernes. Hereof it cometh that the holy ſcriptures, which doe containe all one truth, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſpirites are diuerſly handled.<note place="margin">The ſcripture being one and the ſelfe ſame truth, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly handled of ſundry men</note> One in teaching is mild and gentle: an other more rough and rigorous. Thus the ſpirite of god being pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into diuers veſſels, doth not quench at once the vices of nature: but by litle &amp; litle during this life, he purgeth that ſinne which is roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not onely in the <hi>Galathians,</hi> but alſo in all men of all nations.</p>
                  <p>Albeit then that the <hi>Galathians</hi> were lightned and did beleue, and had now receaued the holy Ghoſt by the preaching of faith, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this remnant of vice (this fooliſhnes I meane) and the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall corruption which afterward did eaſily burſt out in to the flame of falſe doctrine,<note place="margin">Grace by litle and litle clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thoſe that be godly, from their old ſinnes.</note> remained in them ſtill. Wherfore let no man truſt ſo much in himſelfe, to thinke that when he hath receaued grace, he is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly purged from his old vices. In deede many things are purged in vs, and principally the head of the Serpent, that is to ſay, infidelitie &amp; ignorance of God is cutte of and bruſed, but the ſlime and the relikes of ſinne remaine ſtill in vs. Let no man therfore preſume ſo much of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that when he hath once receaued faith, he can by and by be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly chaunged into a new man: Nay, he ſhall keepe ſomewhat of his old vices ſtill hanging vpon him, though he be neuer ſo good and perfect a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <p>Here <hi>Paule</hi> excuſeth the Galathians, and laieth the faulte vpon the falſe Apoſtles. As though he ſhould ſay: I ſee that ye are not falne tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough wilfulnes or malice:<note place="margin">The falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles bevvitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of men.</note> but the Deuill hath ſent the enchaunting falſe Apoſtles his children amongeſt you, and they do ſo bewitch you in teaching you that ye are iuſtified by the lawe, that now ye thinke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of Chriſt then ye did afore when ye heard the Goſpell prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by me. But we labour both by preaching and writing vnto you, to vncharme that ſorcery wherwith the falſe Apoſtles haue bewitched you, and to ſet at libertie thoſe which are ſnared therwith.</p>
                  <p>So we alſo at this day doe labour by the word of God againſt thoſe fantaſticall opinions of the Anabaptiſtes, that we may ſet at libertie thoſe that are entangled therewith, and reduce them to the pure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of faith, and there hold them. And this our labour is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in vaine. For we haue called backe many whom they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, and haue deliuered them out of their ſnares. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch there are as will not ſuffer themſelues to be taught, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the chiefe Sorcerers and authors of this witchery. They wil heare no reaſon, nor admit the ſcripture: yea they abuſe and corrupt the ſcripture, and auoide ſuch places as are alledged againſt them, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their falſe gloſes and deuiliſh dreames cleane contrary to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which is a manifeſt ſigne that they are bewitched of the deuill. Wherefore they are nothing amended by our admonitions, but are much more hardened and more obſtinate then they were before. And ſurely I could neuer haue beleued, but that I haue good experience therof at this day, that the power of the deuill is ſo greate, that he is
<pb facs="tcp:9456:98"/>
able to make falſhod ſo like to the truth. Moreouer (which is yet much more horrible) when he goeth about to ouerwhelme ſorrowfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with ouer much heauines, he can ſo cunningly and ſo liuely chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge himſelfe into the likenes of Chriſt, that it is impoſſible for the poore tempted and afflicted ſoule to perceaue it, wherby many ſimple and ignoraunt perſons are deceaued and driuen downe to deſperation, and ſome alſo deſtroy themſelues. For they are ſo bewitched of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil that they beleue this to be a moſt certaine truth, that they are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and accuſed, not of the deuill, but of Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The example of Doctor Kraus.</note>Such a like thing of late happened to that miſerable man Doctor Kraus of Hal, which ſaid: I haue denied Chriſt, and therfore he ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: now before his father and accuſeth me. He being blinded with the illuſion of the deuil, had ſo ſtrongly conceaued in his minde this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that by no exhortation, no conſolation, no promiſes of God he could be brought from it, wherupon he deſpaired and ſo miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied himſelfe.<note place="margin">The deuils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a falſe Chriſt.</note> This was a meere lie, a bewitching of the deuil, and a fantaſticall definition of a wrong Chriſt whom, the ſcripture knoweth not. For the ſcripture ſetteth forth Chriſt not as a Iudge, a temptour or accuſer: but a reconciler, a mediator, a comforter and a throne of grace.</p>
                  <p>But the poore man deluded by the deuill, could not then ſee this, and therfore againſt al ſcripture he thinketh this to be an vndoubted truth: Chriſt accuſeth thee before his father: he ſtandeth not for thee, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee: therfore thou art damned. And this tentation is not of man, but of the deuill, which that enchaunter moſt ſtrongly imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the heart of the tempted. But vnto vs which are lead and taught by an other ſpirite, it is a manifeſt and a curſed lie, and a plaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching of the deuill. But vnto thoſe that are thus bewitched, it is ſo certaine a truth, that none can be more certaine.</p>
                  <p>Seing then that the deuill is able to print in our hearts ſo manifeſt a lie,<note place="margin">The Godly muſt diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vvatch.</note> that we woulde ſweare a thouſand times it were an vndoubted truth, we muſt not be proud, but walke in feare and humilitie, calling vpon the Lord Ieſus, that we be not lead into tentation. Worldly and ſecure men,<note place="margin">VVorldly and ſecure men, are ſoone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvitched.</note> which after they haue once or twiſe hearde the Goſpell preached by and by imagine that they haue receaued aboundaunce of gods ſpirite, doe fall at length in like manner, becauſe they feare not God nor render thankes vnto him: but perſwade themſelues that they are able, not onely to hold and to maintaine the doctrine of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but alſo to ſtand againſt the deuill in any aſſault or conflicte, be it neuer
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9456:98"/>
were ſo greeuous. Such are meete inſtruments for the Deuill to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch, and to throwe downe to deſperation.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, ſay not thou: I am perfite, I can not fall: but humble thy ſelfe, and feare, leſt if thou ſtand to day, to morrow thou be ouerthrowne. I my ſelfe, although I be a Doctor of diuinitie, and haue nowe preached Chriſt and fought againſt the Deuill in his falſe teachers a great while, doe finde by experience notwithſtanding what a doe I haue to holde faſt and not to loſe Chriſt. For I can not ſhake of Satan as I deſire: neither can I ſo apprehend Chriſt as the ſcriptures ſet him forth: but oftentimes the Deuill ſetteth before mine eyes a falſe Chriſt. But thankes be to God who keepeth vs in the worde, in faith, and in prayer, that we may walke before him in humilitie and feare, and not preſume of our owne wiſedome, righteouſnes, &amp; ſtrength, but truſt in the power of Chriſt, who is ſtrong when we are weake, and by vs weake and feeble creatures he alwayes ouercommeth and triumpheth. To whom be glory for euer.</p>
                  <p>This bewitching and ſorcerie then is nothing elſe but a plaine il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of the Deuill,<note place="margin">VVitchcraft vvhat it is.</note> printing in the hearte a falſe opinion of Chriſt and againſt Chriſt, and he that is deluded with this opinion is bewitched.

Doutles no man.

For in deede they crucifie him a freſh (who was once crucified &amp; roſe againe) both in them ſelues, in the church, and in the hearts of the faithfull: for with their ſpiteful reproches, rebukes, ſclau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders and iniuries they ſpit vpon him, and with their wicked opinions they wounde him and thruſt him thorow, that in them he may die moſt miſerably: and in the ſteade of him they ſet vp a glorious witchcraft, wherby men are ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably charmed and deluded, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not know Chriſt to be their iuſtifier, their reconciler and Sauiour, but a miniſter of ſinne, their accuſer, their iudge and their deſtroyer, which muſt be pacified no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then by our workes and merites.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore <hi>Paule</hi> vſeth in this place very rigorous and bitter wordes, to the ende that he may feare and call backe the Galathians from the doctrine of the falſe Apoſtles.

Theſe ſeeme to be ſimple and plaine words, and without any high elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but in very deede they are ſo mighty, that they exceede all the eloquence of man.

                  <p>The Apoſtle therefore is here kindled with greate zeale, and with bitter words he purſueth &amp; condemneth the preſumption of our owne righteouſnes riſing vpon the obſeruation of the law of God, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it with this impiety, that it crucifieth againe the ſonne of God.

And this doth he being conſtrained by greate neceſſity: for otherwiſe he could not withſtand the falſe Apoſtles, nor defend the righteouſnes of faith againſt them. Albeit then that the law be holy, iuſt, and good, yet muſt it put on as it were the viſour of an hipocrite, if he ſeeke to be iuſtified by workes. Now he preſſeth them with an argument wherof they themſelues had good experience, and which they could not denie.</p>

                  <p>Here againe I admoniſh you that <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh not onely of the ceremoniall lawe, but of the whole lawe.<note place="margin">Paule ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the vvhole lavv.</note> For he groundeth his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon a ſufficient diuiſion. If he ſhould ſpeake but only of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall lawe, it were no ſufficient diuiſion. It is therefore a double horned argument, ſtandinge vpon two partes, whereof the one muſt needes be true and the other falſe: That is, either ye haue receaued the holy Ghoſt by the law, or by the hearing of faith. If it be by the lawe, then is it not by the preaching of faith. If it be by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of faith, then is it not by the law. There is no meane betwixt theſe two. For all that is not the holy Ghoſt or the preaching of faith, is the law. Here are we in the matter of iuſtification. But to come to iuſtification,<note place="margin">Tvvo vvaies to iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</note> there is no other way but either the voice of the Goſpell or the voice of the law. Wherefore the lawe is here taken generally, as wholy ſeparate from the Goſpell. But it is not onely the ceremoniall lawe that is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Goſpell, but alſo the morall law or the ten commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes: therfore <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh here of the whole lawe.</p>
                  <p>His argument therfore is grounded vpon a ſufficient diſtinction, after this ſort. Tell me (ſayth he):<note place="margin">The holi ghoſt is receaued by hearing the vvord of faith and not by the lavve.</note> 
                     <hi>Receaued ye the holy ghoſt by the vvorkes of the lavve, or by the preaching of the Goſpell?</hi> Anſwere me to this. Ye can not ſay that this was done by the lawe. For ſo long as ye were vnder the lawe and did the workes therof, ye neuer recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the holy ghoſt. In deede ye taught and heard the lawe of <hi>Moſes</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Sabboth: but it hath not bene heard or ſeene that euer the holy ghoſt was geuen to any, either teacher or learner, through the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the lawe. Moreouer, ye haue not onely taught and heard the lawe, but alſo ye haue laboured with all your power to performe the ſame by your workes, wherby ye ſhould moſt of all haue receaued the holy ghoſt if he had bene geuen by the lawe,<note place="margin">Neither the teachers nor hearers, nor yet the doers of the lavve, are iuſtified bi the lavve.</note> ſeing ye were not onely teachers and learners, but alſo doers of the law: and yet ye cannot ſhew me that this was done at any time. But as ſoone as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearing of faith or the goſpell came vnto you, by and by ye receaued the holy Ghoſt by the only hearing of faith, before ye had done any worke or ſhewed any frute of the goſpell.

                     <p>But ſome man may here cauill and ſay: who knoweth whether it were the holy ghoſt or no? Wel, let him cauil.

This they do to the ende that they may bring vs into bondage, and that they may wreſt from vs this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, that we are iuſtified, not by faith formed and adorned with chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (as they ſay) but by faith alone.

By this meanes the obiection of the aduerſaries which doe not vnderſtand the true meane of iuſtification, is aunſwered.</p>
                     <p>Here againe the aduerſaries do obiect againſt vs, and ſay: Be it ſo that <hi>Cornelius</hi> was a Gentile &amp; did not receaue the holy Ghoſt by the law, yet notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding foraſmuch as the text ſaith plainly: <hi>that he vvas a iuſt man, fearing God, geuing almes &amp;c.</hi> it might ſeeme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by theſe works he deſerued to haue the holy ghoſt afterwards geuen vnto him.

                     <p>And this article as concerning faith in Chriſt to be reuealed (that I may touch this alſo by the way) is very neceſſary to be knowne.

                        <note place="margin">Galat. 3.2.</note> 
                        <hi>or by the hearing of faith preached?</hi> For they were compelled to graunt, that they heard nothing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt before the preaching of <hi>Paule,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience vvitneſſeth that the holy Ghoſt is not geuen by the lavv, but by the hearing of faith.</note> but when he preached the Goſpel, then receaued they the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>So we alſo at this day, conuicted by the teſtimony of our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the holy ghoſt is not geuen by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law but by the hearinge of faith. For many heretofore in Poperie haue gone about with great labour and ſtudie, to keepe the law, the decrees
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9456:106"/>
of the fathers, and the traditions of the Pope: and ſome with painfull and continuall exerciſes in watching, faſting, and praying &amp;c. did ſo weare and conſume their bodies that they were able to ſuſtaine no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: wherby notwithſtanding they gained nothing els but that they miſerably afflicted and tormented them ſelues. They could neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this, to haue a quiet conſcience and peace in Chriſt, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually they doubted of Gods good will towards them. But now, ſince the Goſpel teacheth that the law and works iuſtifie not, but faith alone in Ieſus Chriſt, there followeth a moſt certaine knowledge and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a moſt ioyfull conſcience and true iudgement of euery kinde of life, and of all things els whatſoeuer. The beleuing man may now eaſily iudge that the Papacy with all the orders and traditions thereof is wicked: which before he could not do.<note place="margin">The blindnes of the Popes kingdome.</note> For ſo great blindenes raing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the world, that we thought thoſe works which men had deuiſed, not onely without the will of God, but alſo contrary to his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, to be much better then thoſe, which the magiſtrate, the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlder, the childe, the ſeruaunte did at the commaundement of God.</p>
                     <p>Doubtles we ought to haue learned by the word of God, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious orders of the Papiſtes (which onely they call holy) are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſince there is no commaundement of God at al, or teſtimony in the holy ſcriptures approuing the ſame.<note place="margin">The orders and kindes of life that are appointed of God.</note> Contrariwiſe other orders of life which haue the word and warrant of God, are holy &amp; ordained of God. But we were then wrapped in ſuch horrible darkenes, that we could not truely iudge of any thing. But now at the appearing of the cleare light of the Goſpell, all kindes of life in the world are vnder our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is moſt certaine &amp; infallible.<note place="margin">The ſtate of ſeruauntes allovved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</note> We may boldly pronounce out of the word of God, that the condition of ſeruauntes, which before the world is moſt vile, is farre more acceptable vnto God then all the religious orders of the Papiſtes. For by his word he commendeth, approueth, and ſetteth forth the ſtate of ſeruauntes, and ſo doth he not, the orders of Monkes, Friers, and ſuch other. Therfore this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grounded vpon experience ought to ſtand in much force with vs alſo. For although diuers men in popery wrought ſundry and diuers works both great and painefull, yet could they neuer be ſure what was the will of God towards them, but they were alwaies in doubt: they could neuer attaine to the knowledge of God, of themſelues, of their calling, nor felte the teſtimony of the ſpirite in their heartes.<note place="margin">The certaintie of true bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</note> But now that the truth of the Goſpell appeareth, they are fully inſtructed by the onely hearing of faith, in all theſe things.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:9456:107"/>It is not without cauſe that I doe ſo largely intreate of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For it ſeemeth to mans reaſon but a light and a ſmall matter to purchaſe the holy ghoſt by the onely hearing of faith, and that nothing els is required of vs but that we, ſetting a parte all our works, ſhould geue our ſelues onely to the hearing of the Goſpell.<note place="margin">By vvhat mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the holy ghoſt is geuen vnto vs.</note> Mans hearte doth not vnderſtand nor beleue that ſo greate a price, namely the holy Ghoſt, is geuen by the onely hearing of faith: but reaſoneth after this ſorte: Forgeuenes of ſinnes, deliueraunce from death, the geuing of the holy Ghoſt, of righteouſnes and euerlaſting life, are greate things: therfore if thou wilt obtaine theſe ineſtimable benefites, thou muſt performe ſome other greate and weighty matter.<note place="margin">The diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans reaſon.</note> This opinion the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill doth wel like and approue, &amp; alſo encreaſeth the ſame in the heart.

So the ineſtimable greatnes of the gift is the cauſe that we can not beleue it: and becauſe this incomparable treaſure is freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, therfore it is deſpiſed.</p>
                     <p>But this muſt we learne, that forgeuenes of ſinnes, Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſt are freely geuen vnto vs at the onely hearing of faith prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, notwithſtanding our horrible ſinnes and demerits. And we muſt not wey, how greate the thing is that is geuen, and how vnworthy we are of it (for ſo ſhould the greatnes of the gift &amp; our vnworthines ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refie vs): but we muſt thinke that it pleaſeth God freely to geue vnto vs this vnſpeakeable gifte: vnto vs (I ſay) which are vnworthy, as Chriſt in Luke ſayeth:<note place="margin">Luke. 12.32.</note> 
                        <hi>Feare not litle flocke: for it is your fathers pleaſure to geue vnto you: (Loe, to geue vnto you,</hi> ſaith he) <hi>a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>

If he offer it and will geue it, I conſider not mine owne ſinne &amp; vnworthines, but his fatherly good will towardes me which is the geuer, and I receaue the greatnes of the gift with ioy and gladnes, &amp; am thankful for ſo ineſtimable a gifte geuen freely vnto me, to me (I ſay) vnworthy, by the hearing of faith.</p>
                     <p>Here againe fooliſh reaſon is offended and reproueth vs ſaying: Where ye teach men to do nothing at all for the obtaining of ſo greate and vnſpeakeable a gift,<note place="margin">VVhat the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries doe obiect againſt vs.</note> but to heare the word of God, this ſeemeth to tend to the greate contempt of grace and to make men ſecure, idle and

                     <p>Our aduerſaries thinke that faith whereby we receaue the holy Ghoſt, is but a light matter: but how high and harde a matter it is I my ſelfe doe finde by experience, and ſo doe all they which with me doe earneſtly embrace the ſame. It is ſoone ſaide that by the onely hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of faith, the holy Ghoſt is receaued: but it is not ſo eaſily heard, laied holde on, beleued and retained, as it is ſaid.

<pb facs="tcp:9456:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mortifie thy fleſh.</p>
                     <p>The faithfull doe finde by their owne experience howe gladly they would hold and embrace the word when they heare it, with a full faith, and abandon this opinion of the lawe and of their owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes:<note place="margin">The conflict of the flesh againſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite in the godly.</note> but they feele in their fleſh a mightie reſiſtaunce againſt the ſpirite.

                  <p>This argument being concluded, how that the holy ghoſt cometh not by the workes of the lawe, but through the preaching of faith: he beginneth here to exhort the Galathians, and to terrifie them from a double daunger and incommoditie. The firſt is: <hi>Are ye ſo foolish that after ye haue begone in the ſpirite, ye vvould novv ende in the flesh?</hi> The other followeth: <hi>Haue ye ſuffred ſo great things in vaine?</hi> As if he ſaid:<note place="margin">To begin in the ſpirite.</note> Ye began in the ſpirite: that is, your religion was excellently well begone.

Forſoth ye will nowe ende in the fleſh, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye are ended in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> here ſetteth the ſpirite againſt the fleſh. He calleth not the fleſh (as before I haue ſaid) luſt, beaſtly paſſions, or ſenſual appetites:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9456:108"/>
for he intreateth not here of luſt or of other fleſhly deſires: but of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes of ſinnes, of iuſtifying the conſcience, of obteining righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes before God, of deliueraunce from the lawe, ſinne, and death: and yet notwithſtanding he ſayth here, that they, forſaking the ſpirite, doe now ende in the fleſh.<note place="margin">VVhat flesh ſignifieth in this place.</note> Fleſh therfore is here taken for the very righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and wiſedome of the fleſh and the iudgement of reaſon, which goeth about to be made righteous by the law. Whatſoeuer then is beſt and moſt excellent in man (as the wiſedome of reaſon, yea, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of the law it ſelfe) the ſame here <hi>Paule</hi> calleth fleſh.</p>
                  <p>And this place muſt be well weyed and conſidered, becauſe of the ſlaunderous and cauilling Papiſts, which wreſt the ſame againſt vs, ſaying that we in Poperie began in the ſpirite, but now, hauing mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wiues, we ende in the fleſh. As though a ſingle life, or not to haue a wife were a ſpirituall life: and as though it nothing hindred their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, if a man not contented with one whore, haue many. They are mad men, not vnderſtanding what the ſpirite, or what the fleſh is. The ſpirite is whatſoeuer is done in vs through the ſpirite: The fleſh,<note place="margin">The ſpirite. The flesh.</note> whatſoeuer is done in vs according to the fleſh without the ſpirite. Wherfore all the dueties of a Chriſtian man, as to loue his wife, to bring vp his children, to gouerne his familie, and ſuch like,<note place="margin">VVhat the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes call vvorldly and carnall.</note> which vnto them are worldly and carnal, are the frutes of the ſpirite. Theſe blinde buzzardes can not diſcerne the things, which are the good creatures of God, from vices.</p>
                  <p>Here alſo is to be noted, that the Apoſtle ſayth, the Galathians did begin in the ſpirite. He ſhould here haue added actiuely: <hi>Nunc car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne conſummatis?</hi> that now ye ende in the fleſh? But he doth not ſo: but ſayth paſſiuely, <hi>carne conſummamini:</hi> that ye ende, yea, or rather are ended in the fleſh? The righteouſnes of the law which <hi>Paule</hi> here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the fleſh, is ſo farre of from iuſtifying, that they which after the receauing of the holy ghoſt through the hearing of faith, fall backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto it, are ended in it, that is to ſay, are vtterly deſtroyed. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who ſo euer teach that the lawe ought to be fulfilled to this ende, that men might be iuſtified thereby, whiles they goe about to quiet their conſciences, they hurt them, &amp; whiles they would iuſtifie them, they condemne them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> euermore by the way hath a glaunce at theſe falſe apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, for they ſtil vrged the law, ſaying: Faith onely in Chriſt taketh not away ſinne, pacifieth not the wrath of God, iuſtifieth not: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ye will obtaine theſe benefites, ye muſt not onely beleeue in

Chriſt: but therwith ye muſt alſo keepe the law, be circumciſed, keepe the feaſtes, ſacrifices. &amp;c. Thus doing ye ſhall be free from ſinne, from the wrath of God, from euerlaſting death: yea rather (ſayth <hi>Paule</hi>) by the ſelfe ſame things ye eſtabliſh vnrighteouſnes, ye prouoke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God, ye adde ſinne to ſinne, ye quench the ſpirite, ye fall away from grace, and vtterly reiect the ſame, and ye together with your diſciples doe ende in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh.

                  <p>Hereby it appeareth ſufficiently what inconuenience the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of the lawe and mans owne righteouſnes bringeth:<note place="margin">VVhat incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ovvne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, or the righteouſnes of the lavv doe bring.</note> to witte, that they which truſt in it, doe loſe at once vnſpeakeable benefites.

                  <p>When a preacher then ſo preacheth that the word is not deſtitute of his frute, but effectuall in the heartes of the hearers, that is to ſay: when faith, hope, loue and pacience do follow, then God geueth his ſpirite and worketh miracles in the hearers. In like manner <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith here, <hi>that God hath geuen his ſpirite to the Galathians, &amp; hath vvrought miracles among them.</hi> As though he would ſay: God hath not onely brought to paſſe through my preaching, that ye ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue: but alſo that ye ſhould liue holily, bring forth many frutes of faith, and ſuffer many afflictions. Alſo by the ſame power of the holy Ghoſt, of adulterers, of wrathfull, impacient, and couetous perſons, and of very enemies, ye are become liberall, chaſt, gentle, pacient, and louers of your neighbours.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:9456:110"/>
vehemently that they were ready to haue plucked out their owne eyes for him.</p>
                  <p>Now, to loue thy neighbour ſo heartily, that thou art ready to beſtow thy money, thy goods, thine eyes, and all that thou haſt for his ſaluation: and moreouer to ſuffer patiently all aduerſities and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, theſe (no doubt) are the effects &amp; fruits of the ſpirite, &amp; theſe (ſaith he) you receaued and enioyed before theſe falſe teachers came among you. But ye receaued them not by the lawe, but of God, who ſo mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto you, and daily encreaſed in you his holy ſpirite, that the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell had a moſt happie courſe amongſte you in teaching, beleeuing, working and ſuffring. Now, ſeeing ye know theſe things (being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted euen by the teſtimonie of your owne conſciences), howe cometh it to paſſe that ye ſhewe not forth the ſame fruites that ye did before: that is, that ye teache not truely, that ye beleeue not faithfully, that ye liue not holily, that ye worke not rightly, and that ye ſuffer not pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently? Finally, who hath ſo corrupted you, that ye beare not ſo louing affection towards me, as ye did before? that ye receaue not <hi>Paule</hi> now as an Angell of God, nor as Chriſt Ieſus? that ye will not plucke out your eyes to geue them vnto me? How cometh it to paſſe (I ſay) that this feruent zeale of yours waxeth ſo colde towardes me, and that ye now preferre before me the falſe apoſtles which doe ſo miſerably ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you?</p>
                  <p>In like manner it hapneth vnto vs at this day. When we firſt preached the Goſpell, there were very many that fauoured our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and had a good and a reuerent opinion of vs: and after the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching therof, followed the operations and effectes of faith. But what came then? A ſort of light and brainſicke heads ſprang vp, and by and by deſtroyed all that we had in long time and with much trauaile pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, and alſo made vs ſo odious vnto them which before loued vs dearely, and thankfully receaued our doctrine, that nowe they hate nothing more then our name.<note place="margin">The vvorkes of the Deuill.</note> But the Deuill is the aucthor of this miſchiefe, working in his members contrary ſignes, which wholy fight againſt the operations of the holy Ghoſt. Therfore, ſayth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, your experience (O ye Galathians) ought to teach you, that theſe great and excellent miracles proceeded not of the workes of the law. For as ye had them not before the hearing of faith preached: ſo haue ye them not nowe, although the falſe apoſtles raigne in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of you.</p>
                  <p>Therfore we alſo may ſay to them at this day which vaunt them
<pb facs="tcp:9456:111"/>
ſelues to be goſpellers, and to be freed from the tyrannie of the Pope: haue ye ouercome the tyrannie of the Pope, and obtained libertie in Chriſt through the Anabaptiſtes and ſuch other fanaticall ſpirites, or through vs which haue preached faith in Ieſus Chriſt? Here if they will confeſſe the truth, they muſt needes ſay: no doubt, it was by the preaching of faith.<note place="margin">VVhat happie ſucceſſe the goſpell had vvhen it vvas firſt preached.</note> And true it is, that in the beginning of our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, the doctrine of faith had a moſt happy courſe, and downe fell the Popes pardones, purgatorie, vowes, Maſſes, and ſuch like abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which drue with them the ruine of al Poperie. No man could iuſtly condemne vs: for our doctrine was pure, raiſing vp and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting many poore conſciences, which had bene long oppreſſed with mens traditions vnder the Papacie: which was a plaine tyrannie, a racking and crucifying of conſciences. Many therfore gaue thankes vnto God, that through the Goſpell (which by the grace of God we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt preached) they were ſo mightely deliuered out of theſe ſnares,<note place="margin">The Popedom a very ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terhouſe of conſciences.</note> and this ſlaughterhouſe of conſciences. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe new fond heads ſprang vp (who went about by all meanes to worke our diſcredite) then began our doctrine to be euill thought of: for it was commonly bruted abrode, that the profeſſors therof diſagreed among themſelues. Wherat many being greatly offended, fell quite from the truth, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Papiſtes in comfort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we together with our doctrine, ſhould ſhortly come to naught, and by this meanes they ſhould recouer their former dignitie and authoritie againe.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, like as the falſe apoſtles vehemently contended y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Galathians now iuſtified by faith in Chriſt ought to be circumciſed &amp; to kepe the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if they would be deliuered from their ſinnes and from the wrath of God, and obtaine the holy Ghoſt: and yet notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     <hi>Paule</hi> by theſe wordes, <hi>Abraham beleeued,</hi> maketh the cheefeſt worſhip, the cheefeſt duetie, the cheefeſt obedience and the cheefeſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, of faith in God.

Nowe, to geue glory vnto God,<note place="margin">To geue glory to God.</note> is to beleeue in him, to count him true, wiſe, righteous, merciful, almighty, briefly to acknowledge him to be the author and geuer of all goodnes.<note place="margin">Faith geueth glory to God.</note> This reaſon doth not, but faith. That is it which maketh vs diuine people, and (as a man would ſay) it is the creator of a certaine diuinitie, not in the ſubſtaunce of God, but in vs. For without faith God loſeth in vs his glory, wiſedom, righteouſnes, truth, and mercy. To conclude: There no maieſtie or diuinitie remaineth vnto God, where faith is not. And the cheefeſt thing that God requireth of man is, that he geue vnto him his glory and his diuinitie: that is to ſay, that he take him not for an idoll, but for God: who regardeth him, heareth him, ſheweth mercy vnto him, and helpeth him. This being done, then hath God his full and perfect diuinitie, that is, he hath whatſoeuer a faithfull heart can attribute vnto him. To be able therfore to geue that glory vnto God, it is the wiſedom of wiſedomes, the righteouſnes of righteouſneſſes, the religion of religions, and ſacrifice of ſacrifices.

becauſe of this faith in Chriſt, God ſeeth not my doubting of his good will towards me, my diſtruſt, my heauines of ſpirite, and other ſinnes which are yet in me.

                  <p>So we ſhroud our ſelues vnder the couering of Chriſtes fleſh, who is our <hi>cloudy piller for the day, and our fire by the night,</hi> leſt God ſhould ſee our ſinne. And although we ſee it, and for the ſame doe feele the terrors of conſcience, yet flying vnto Chriſt our Mediatour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler (through whom we are made perfect), we are ſure and ſafe: For as all things are in him, ſo through him we haue all things, who alſo doth ſupply whatſoeuer is wanting in vs. When we beleue this, God winketh at all our ſinnes and the remnantes thereof which are yet ſticking in our fleſh, and will haue them ſo couered as though they were no ſinnes.

When the popiſh Scholemen heare this definition, they laugh at it. For they imagine that righteouſnes is a certaine quality powred into the ſoule, and afterwards ſpread into all the partes of man.

                  <p>This matter, as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words, is eaſie (to wit, that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is not eſſentially in vs, but without vs in the grace of God onely &amp; in his imputation: and that there is no eſſentiall ſubſtance of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes in vs beſides that weake faith or firſt frutes of faith, whereby we haue begon to apprehend Chriſt, and yet ſinne in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meane time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth verely in vs): but in very deede it is no ſuch ſmal or light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but earneſt &amp; of weighty importance.

                  <p>Hereby now we may ſee, how faith iuſtifieth without works, and yet notwithſtanding, how imputation of righteouſnes is alſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

And hereby they would proue that the arguments and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations of <hi>Paule</hi> doe conclude nothing. In like manner they may cauill alſo, that the place which <hi>Paule</hi> a litle after alledgeth out of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacuc ſpeaketh of faith concerning the accompliſhing of the whole viſion, and not of faith onely in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Habac. 1.4.</note> for the which <hi>Paule</hi> alledgeth it.

By theſe things ſuch vaineglorious and arrogant ſpirites doe hunt for praiſe, and ſeeke to be counted wiſe and learned, where they leaſt of all deſerue it. But becauſe of the ſimple and ignoraunt we will briefly anſwer to their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillations.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt I aunſwere thus, that faith is nothing elſe but the truth of the hearte: that is to ſay, a true and a right opinion of the hearte as touching God. Now, faith only thinketh and iudgeth rightly of God,<note place="margin">Faithe.</note> and not reaſon. And then a man thinketh rightly of God,<note place="margin">Faith thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>keth aright of God, and not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> when he bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his word. But when he will meaſure God without the word, and beleue him according to the wiſedome of reaſon, he hath no right opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of God in his heart and therfore he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not thinke or iudge of him as he ſhould doe. As for example: when a Monke imagineth that his Cowle, his ſhauen croune and his vowes doe pleaſe God, &amp; that grace and euerlaſting life is geuen vnto him for the ſame,<note place="margin">Truth and faith ſignifie both one thing.</note> he hath no true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of God, but falſe and full of impietie. Truth therfore is faith it ſelfe, which iudgeth rightly of God, namely that God regardeth not our works &amp; righteouſnes, becauſe we are vncleane: but that he will haue mercy vpon vs, looke vpon vs, accept vs, iuſtifie vs and ſaue vs,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.24. Iohn. 11.25.26. Heb. 9.11. Heb. 10.</note> if we beleue in his Sonne whom he hath ſent to be a ſacrifice for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinnes of the whole world. This is a true opinion of God, and in very deede nothing elſe but faith it ſelfe. I can not comprehend nor be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured by reaſon, that I am receaued into gods fauour for Chriſtes

ſake: but I heare this to be pronounced by the Goſpell, and I lay hold vpon it by faith.</p>
                  <p>To the ſeconde cauillation I anſwere, that <hi>Paule</hi> doth rightly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the place out of the .15. of Geneſis, applying it to faith in Chriſt. For with faith alwayes muſt be ioyned a certaine aſſurance of Gods mercy.<note place="margin">That Paule doth rightly alledge that place out of the .15. of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis, and to his purpoſe.</note> Now, this aſſurance comprehendeth a faithfull truſt of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes for Chriſtes ſake. For it is impoſſible that the conſcience ſhould looke for any thing at Gods hand, except firſt it be aſſured, that God is mercifull vnto it for Chriſtes ſake. Therfore all the promiſes are to be referred to that firſt promiſe concerning Chriſt: <hi>The ſeede of the vvoman shall bruſe the ſerpents head.</hi>

By this we ſee that the faith of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the olde Teſtament, and ours nowe in the newe is all one, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they differ as touching their outward obiectes.

                     <hi>and he ſavve it and vvas glad.</hi> Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, the faith of the fathers was grounded in Chriſt which was to come, as ours is nowe in Chriſt which is now reuealed. <hi>Abraham</hi> in his time was made righteous through faith in Chriſt to come, but if he liued at this day, he ſhould be made righteous by faith in Chriſt now alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reuealed and preſent:<note place="margin">Actes. 10.1.2.3.</note> Like as I ſaid before of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who at the firſt beleeued in Chriſt to come, but being inſtructed by <hi>Peter,</hi> he beleeued that Chriſt was already come. Therfore the diuerſitie of times neither chaungeth faith, nor the holy Ghoſt, nor the gifts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">That, the place of Gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſis may vvell be applied to faith in chriſt.</note>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> therfore (as I haue ſaid) rightly alledgeth that place out of Geneſis of faith in Chriſt, when he ſpeaketh of the faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> For all the promiſes paſt, were contained in Chriſt to come.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:9456:118"/>
Therfore as well <hi>Abraham</hi> and the other fathers, as alſo we are made righteous by faith in Chriſt: They by faith in him to come, we by faith in him now preſent.

It is enough therfore that <hi>Paule</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the law iuſtifieth not, but onely faith, whether it be in Chriſt to come, or in Chriſt already come.</p>
                  <p>At this day alſo Chriſt to ſome is preſent, to other ſome he is to come.

                  <p>Hereby then we ſee that to <hi>bleſſe</hi> ſignifieth nothing els, but (as I ſaide before) to preach and teach the worde of the Goſpell, to confeſſe Chriſt, and to ſpread abroad the knowledge of him among all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.

                  <p>It was in deede a greate glorie that <hi>Abraham</hi> receaued circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion at the commaundement of God, that he was endued with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertues, that he obeied God in all things: as it is alſo a greate praiſe and felicitie to follow the example of Chriſt working, to loue thy neighbour, to doe good to them that hurt thee, to pray for thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, patiently to beare the ingratitude of thoſe which render euill for good: but all this auaileth nothing to righteouſnes before God. The excellent deedes and vertues of <hi>Abraham</hi> were not the cauſe that he was counted righteous before God: So likewiſe the imitation and following of the example of Chriſt doth not make vs righteous before God. For, to make vs righteous before God, there is a farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent price required, which is neither the righteouſnes of man, nor yet of the law.

A man beleuing in Chriſt is altogither a diuine man, the child of God, the inheritour of the world, a conquerour of ſinne, death, the world and the Deuill: therefore he can not be praiſed and magnified enough. Let vs not ſuffer this faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> to lie hid in his graue, as he is hid from the Iewes: but let vs highly extoll and magnifie him, and let vs fill both heauen and earth with his name: ſo that in reſpect of this

                  <p>Here ye ſee that the Curſe is as it were a floude ſwallowing vp whatſoeuer is without <hi>Abraham:</hi> that is to ſay, without faith and the promiſe of the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now, if the law it ſelfe geuen by <hi>Moſes</hi> at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of God, maketh them ſubiect to the Curſe which are vnder it, much more ſhall the lawes and traditions deuiſed by mans braine doe the ſame. He therefore that will auoid the Curſe, muſt lay hold vpon the promiſe of Bleſſing, or vpon the faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or els ſhall he abide vnder the Curſe. Vpon this place therefore <hi>[shalbe bleſſed in thee]</hi> it followeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all nations, whether they were before <hi>Abraham,</hi> in his time, or after him, are accurſed &amp; ſhall remaine vnder the Curſe for euer, vnleſſe they be bleſſed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> vnto whom the promiſe of Bleſſing was geuen to be publiſhed by his ſeede throughout the whole world.</p>

comfort troubled and afflicted conſciences:<note place="margin">The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of faith and ciuill righteouſnes.</note> moreouer they teach vs to ſeparate the righteouſnes of Faith from the righteouſnes of the fleſh or ciuill righteouſnes. For we muſt note that <hi>Paule</hi> here is in hande, not with a matter of policie, but with a matter diuine and ſpirituall before God, leſt any mad braine ſhould cauill, and ſay that he curſeth and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth politike lawes and Magiſtrates. Here all the Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and popiſh Scholemen are dumme and can ſay nothing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the readers muſt be admoniſhed that in this place ther is nothing handled as touching ciuill lawes,<note place="margin">Ciuill lavves and ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are good, and of God.</note> or touching manners and matters politicall (which are the ordinaunces of God and good thinges, and the ſcripture elſewhere approueth and commendeth the ſame), but of a ſpirituall righteouſnes, by which we are iuſtified before God, and are called the children of God in the kingdom of heauen. To be briefe, there is nothing handled here concerning the bodily life, but concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euerlaſting life, where no bleſſing is to be hoped for, or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes to be ſought either through the law, or traditions, or whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can be named in this life, beſides the promiſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Let ciuill lawes and ordinaunces abide in their right place and order: let the magiſtrate make good and notable lawes, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they deliuer no man from the Curſe of Gods law. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Babylon</hi> ordained of God, and by him committed vnto Kings, had excellent lawes, and all nations were commaunded to obey them: notwithſtanding this obedience of the lawes did not ſaue it from the Curſe of the lawe of God. In like manner we obey the lawes of Princes and magiſtrates, but we are not thereby made righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: For here we are in an other matter.</p>
                  <p>It is not without cauſe that I doe ſo earneſtly vrge this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">The righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of faith and ciuill righteouſnes are eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</note> For it is very neceſſary to knowe it. Albeit there are very fewe that doe marke it and vnderſtand it in deede. Againe, the confounding and mingling together of the heauenly and ciuill righteouſnes, is very eaſie. In the ciuill righteouſnes we muſt haue regarde to lawes and workes, but in the ſpirituall, diuine and heauenly righteouſnes, we muſt vtterly reiect all lawes and workes, and ſet the onely promiſe and Bleſſing before our eies, which layeth before vs Chriſt the geuer of this Bleſſing and of grace, and our onely Sauiour. So that this ſpirituall righteouſnes, ſecluding the law and all workes, looketh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto the grace and bleſſing which is geuen by Chriſt, as it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and of him beleued.</p>
                  <p>Hereby we may plainely ſee, that this argument is inuincible. For
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:9456:123"/>
if we muſt hope to receaue this bleſſing by Chriſt alone, then it muſt needes followe of the contrary that it is not receaued by the law. For the bleſſing was geuen to faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> before the law and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the law. Now, like as <hi>Abraham</hi> beleued in Chriſt to come, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the Bleſſing: ſo and by the ſame faith, we beleue in Chriſt being come, and ſo are we now iuſtified by faith, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was then iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith. They therfore which are vnder the lawe are not bleſſed, but doe remaine vnder the Curſe.</p>
                  <p>This the Pope and his proude Prelates neither doe nor can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, neither can they abide this doctrine. Yet muſt we not holde our peace, but muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe the truth and ſay, that the Papacie is accurſed: yea all the lawes and ciuill ordinaunces of the Emperour are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: For according to <hi>Paule,</hi> whatſoeuer is without the promiſe and faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is accurſed. When our aduerſaries heare this, by and by they peruert and ſclau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der our words,<note place="margin">Hovv the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries ſclau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der and vvreſt our vvordes.</note> as though we taught that the Magiſtrates ſhould not be honoured, but that we raiſe vp ſeditions againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, that we condemne all lawes, that we ouerthrow and deſtroy common weales &amp;c. But they doe vs greate wronge. For we put a difference betwene the corporall and the ſpirituall Bleſſing, and we ſay that the Emperour is bleſſed with a corporall bleſſing. For to haue a kingdom, lawes, and ciuill ordinaunces, to haue a wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, houſe and landes is a bleſſing. For all theſe thinges are the good creatures and giftes of God.<note place="margin">The corporall bleſſing deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth vs not from ſinnes.</note> But we are not deliuered from the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Curſe by this corporall bleſſing, which is but temporall and muſt haue an ende. Therefore we condemne not lawes, neither doe we ſtirre vp ſedition againſt the Emperour: but we teach that he muſt be obeied, that he muſt be feared, reuerenced and honoured, but yet ciuily. But when we ſpeake of the bleſſing after the manner of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, then we ſay boldely with <hi>Paule,</hi> that all thinges which are without the faith and promiſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are accurſed and abide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly and euerlaſting Curſe. For ther we muſt looke for an other life after this, &amp; an other Bleſſing after this corporall Bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>To conclude,<note place="margin">Corporall things are the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God.</note> we ſay that all corporall things are the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God. Therefore (as I haue ſaid) to haue wife, children, goodes, to haue politike lawes and orders, are the good bleſſings of God in their place: that is to ſay, they are temporall bleſſings belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to this life. But theſe bleſſinges the Iuſticiaries and Lawwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of all ages, as the Iewes, Papiſts &amp; Sectaries, and ſuch like, do confound and mingle together. For they put no difference betweene
<pb facs="tcp:9456:124"/>
corporall and ſpirituall bleſſings. Therefore they ſay: We haue a lawe, and this lawe is good, holy, and righteous: therefore we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified through it.<note place="margin">The lavve of ſinne, vvrath, and death.</note> Who denieth but that the lawe is good, holy, &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous? And yet is it alſo the lawe of malediction, of ſinne, of wrath, and of death. Therfore we make here a diſtinction betweene the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirituall Bleſſing, &amp; ſay, that God hath a double Bleſſing: one corporall for this life,<note place="margin">Corporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſings are to be ſundred from ſpirituall bleſsings.</note> and an other ſpirituall for the euerlaſting life. Therfore to haue ritches, children and ſuch like, we ſay it is a bleſſing, but in his degree, that is to ſay, in this life preſent. But as touching life euerlaſting, it is not enough to haue corporall bleſſings: for the very wicked doe therein abound moſte of all. It is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that we haue ciuill righteouſnes or the righteouſnes of the law: for therein alſo the wicked doe ſpecially flouriſh. Theſe things God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributeth in the world freely, &amp; beſtoweth them both vpon the good and bad, like as he ſuffereth the Sunne to riſe both vpon the good and the euill,<note place="margin">God beſtovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his giftes both vpon the good &amp; euill. <hi>Rom. 1.20.</hi>
                     </note> and ſendeth raine vpon the righteous and vnrighteous: for he is liberall vnto all. And to him it is a ſmall matter to put all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vnder the feete of the wicked. <hi>The Creature is ſubiect to vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, not of his ovvne vvill. <hi>Rom. 8.</hi>
                     </hi> They therfore which haue but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe corporall bleſſings, are not the children of God, bleſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſpiritually, as was <hi>Abraham:</hi> but they are vnder the Curſe, as <hi>Paule</hi> here ſayth: <hi>VVhoſoeuer is vnder the vvorkes of the lavv, is vnder the Curſe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> might haue ſayd by a generall propoſition: Whatſoeuer is without faith, is vnder the Curſe. He ſayth not ſo, but he taketh that which beſides faith is the beſt, the greateſt, and moſt excellent among all corporall bleſſings of the world: to witte, the lawe of God. That lawe (ſayth he) in deede is holy and geuen of God: notwithſtanding it doth nothing elſe but make all men ſubiect to the Curſe and keepe them vnder the ſame.<note place="margin">The effectes of the lavve.</note> Nowe, if the lawe of God doe make men ſubiect to the Curſe, much more doe the inferior lawes and bleſſings.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:9456:124"/>
                     <hi>27.</hi> of Deuteronomie, that all men which are vnder the lawe or vnder the workes of the law, are accurſed, or vnder the Curſe: that is to ſay, vnder ſinne, the wrath of God, and euerlaſting death. For he ſpeaketh not (as I haue ſayd before) of a corporall, but of a ſpirituall Curſe, which muſt needes be the Curſe of euerlaſting death and hell fire. And this is a wonderfull maner of prouing. For <hi>Paule</hi> proueth this affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue ſentence which he boroweth out of <hi>Moſes: VVhoſoeuer are of the vvorkes of the lavve are vnder the Curſe:</hi> by this negatiue: <hi>Curſed is euery one that abideth not in all things &amp;c.</hi> Now theſe two ſentences of <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Moiſes</hi> ſeeme cleane contrary. <hi>Paule</hi> ſayeth: whoſoeuer ſhall doe the workes of the lawe, is accurſed. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayth: who ſo euer ſhall not do the works of the law, are accurſed. How ſhall theſe two ſayings be reconciled together? or elſe, (which is more) how ſhall the one be proued by the other?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> (no dout) being among the Galathians, had before more largely entreated of this matter: for elſe they could not haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, ſeeing he doth here but touche it by the way. But becauſe they had heard him declare the ſame vnto them before, they being now againe put in minde thereof, doe call it to remembraunce.

                     </hi> Very well.

                  <p>It is impoſſible therfore that we ſhould doe the law in ſuch forte as they imagine, much leſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould be iuſtified therby.

Then doe they loue God and their neighbour, then doe they good works and carie the croſſe patiently. This is to doe the law true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in deede: otherwiſe the law remaineth alwaies vndone. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if thou will define truely and plainly what it is to do the law, it is nothing els, but to beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, and when the holy Ghoſt is receaued through faith in Chriſt, to worke thoſe things which are commaunded in the lawe: and otherwiſe we are not able to performe the lawe. For the ſcripture ſaith, that there is no bleſſing without the promiſe,<note place="margin">To doe the lavv.</note> no not in the lawe. It is impoſſible therefore to performe the law w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the promiſe, for the Bleſſing muſt needes goe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>all, which is the preaching &amp; publiſhing of Chriſte, who was promiſed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that the world ſhould be bleſſed through him: otherwiſe, we ſhall neuer performe the law.</p>

which are wrought, as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in playing the carpenter becometh a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter: but in diuine matters the workers are not made of the workes going before, but the perſons made and framed already by faith which is in Chriſt, are now become doers &amp; workers. Of ſuch ſpeaketh <hi>Paule</hi> when he ſaith: <hi>The doers of the lavv shalbe iuſtified,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.13.</note> ſhalbe counted righteous.</p>
                  <p>Yea,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes.</note> the very Sophiſters and popiſh Scholemen are compelled to confeſſe, and ſo they teach alſo, that a morall worke outwardly done, if it be not done with a pure heart, a good will, and true intent, it is but hypocriſie. And hereof cometh the prouerbe among the Germaines: Such a cowle couereth many a knaue. For the vileſt and the wickedſt knaue in the world may counterfeit the ſame works that a godly man worketh by faith. <hi>Iudas</hi> did the ſame workes that the other Apoſtles did. What fault was there in the works of <hi>Iudas,</hi> ſeing he did the ſelfe ſame workes that the other Apoſtles did? Here marke what the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter aunſwereth out of his morall Philoſophie. Although he did the ſelfe ſame works (ſaith he) which the other Apoſtles did, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, becauſe the perſon was reprobate, &amp; the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, therefore his workes were hypocriticall and not true, as were the workes of the other Apoſtles, how like ſoeuer they ſeemed to be in outward ſhewe. Wherfore they them ſelues are conſtrained to graunt that in politike and externall matters workes doe not iuſtifie vnleſſe there be ioyned withall an vpright heart, will, and iudgement.<note place="margin">In policie the vvorke is not iudged to be good, except it be done vvith a good vvill much more in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note> Howe much more are they compelled to confeſſe the ſame in ſpirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where, before all things, there muſt be a knowledge of God and faith which may purifie the hearte? They walke therefore in workes and in the righteouſnes of the law, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did in the works of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: not vnderſtanding what they ſay or what they affirme. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith plainely euery where that the law iuſtifieth not,<note place="margin">The effectes of the lavv.</note> but cauſeth wrath, vttereth ſinne, reueileth the indignation and iudgement of God, and threateneth euerlaſting death: yet notwithſtanding rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe things they ſee them not, much leſſe doe they vnderſtand them. Therefore they deſerue not to be called hypocrites, but viſours and ſhadowes of diſguiſed hypocrites, moſte miſerably bewitched in that they dreame that they are made righteous by the workes of the lawe. Wherefore (as I haue ſaid) this worde <hi>[Doer of the lavv]</hi> as they define it, is an imagined terme, a very monſter, and no where to be founde.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, when <hi>Paule</hi> proueth this place: <hi>VVhoſoeuer are
<pb facs="tcp:9456:127"/>
are of the vvorks of the lavv are vnder the</hi> curſe,<note place="margin">Galath. 3.</note> by this ſentence of <hi>Moiſes: Curſed is euery one that abideth not in all that is vvrytten in this booke:</hi> he proueth not one contrary by an other, as at the firſt ſight it may appeare, but he proueth it rightly and in true order. For <hi>Moiſes</hi> meaneth and teacheth the ſelfe ſame thing that <hi>Paule</hi> doth, when he ſayeth: <hi>Curſed is euery one vvhich shall not doe all</hi> &amp;c. But no man doeth them: therfore whoſoeuer are of the workes of the lawe keepe not the lawe. If they keepe it not, they are vnder the curſe. But ſeeing there be two ſortes of men that are doers of the lawe (as before I haue ſayde,) true doers and hypocrites, the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt be ſeperated from the hypocrites. The true doers of the lawe are they which through Faith are the good tree before the fruite, doers and workers before the works. Of theſe ſpeaketh <hi>Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> alſo: and except they be ſuch, they are vnder the Curſe. But the hypocrites are not of this ſorte: for they haue this opinion, that they will obtaine righteouſnes through their workes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make the perſon iuſt and acceptable. For thus they thinke: We that are ſinners and vnrighteous, will be made righteous. Howe ſhall that be? By good woorkes. Therefore they doe euen like as a fooliſh builder which goeth about of the rouffe to make the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: of the fruites to make the tree. For when they ſeeke to be iuſtified by woorkes, of the woorkes they would make the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, which is directly againſt <hi>Moiſes,</hi> which maketh ſuch a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſubiect to the curſe as well as <hi>Paule</hi> doth. Therefore whiles they goe about to doe the lawe, they not onely doe it not, but alſo denie (as I haue ſayd) the firſt commaundement,<note place="margin">The vvicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and error of hypocrites.</note> the promiſes of God, the promiſed Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham:</hi> they renounce Faith, and they goe about to make them ſelues bleſſed by their owne workes: that is to ſay, to make them ſelues righteous, to deliuer them ſelues from ſinne and death, to ouercome the Deuill, and by violence to lay holde vppon the kingdome of heauen. And this is plainly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce God, and to ſet them ſelues in the place of God. For all theſe are the workes of the diuine Maieſtie alone, and not of any creature either in heauen or in earth.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Paule</hi> was able eaſily to foreſhewe out of the firſt commaundement, the abhominations that were to come, which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhould bring into the Church. For all they which teach that any other worſhippe is neceſſary to ſaluation,<note place="margin">The vvorship of the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.</note> then that which God requireth of vs by the firſt commaundement, which is the feare of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:9456:127"/>
God, Faith and the loue of God, are plaine Antichriſtes and ſet them ſelues in the place of God. That ſuch ſhould come, Chriſte him ſelfe foretolde, when he ſayeth in the xxiiii. Chapter of Mathew: <hi>Many shall come in my name, ſaying: I am Chriſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 24.5.</note> So we alſo at this day may boldely and eaſily pronounce, that who ſoeuer ſeeketh righteouſnes by workes without faith,<note place="margin">The godly iudge al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs.</note> denieth God and maketh him ſelfe God. For thus he thinketh: If I doe this worke, I ſhall be righteous, I ſhall be a conquerer of ſinne, death, the Deuill, the wrath of God, and of hell, and ſhall obtaine life euerlaſting. And what is this els (I pray you) but to chalenge that worke vnto him ſelfe which doth belong to God alone, and to ſhew in deede that he him ſelfe is God? Therefore it is an eaſie matter for vs to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and moſt certainely to Iudge of all thoſe which are without faith, that they are not onely Idolaters, but very Idols, which denie God and ſet them ſelues in the place of God.

                  <p>And in the olde teſtament all the propheſies againſt Idolatry ſprang out of the firſt commaundement.

So then they wil haue a right iudgement of reaſon, and a good intent to goe before the work, that is to ſay, they make the perſon morally righteous before the worke. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe in Diuinitie and in ſpiritual matters, where they ought moſt of all ſo to doe, ſuch dull and ſenſeles aſſes they are that they peruert and turne all quite contrary, placing the worke before right reaſon and the good intent.</p>

For in theſe and ſuch like places (as I haue ſaid) he ſpeaketh of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound faith, and not of a naked and ſimple faith. And the meaning of this place: <hi>Do this and thou shalt liue,</hi> is this. Thou ſhalt liue becauſe of this faithful Doing, or this Doing ſhall geue vnto thee life, becauſe of thy faith alone. After this manner iuſtification is attributed to faith alone, as creation is to the diuinitie. And yet notwithſtanding as it is truly ſaide: Ieſus the ſonne of Marie created all thinges, ſo alſo iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is attributed to the incarnate faith, or to the faithfull Doing. Therefore we muſt in no wiſe thinke with the Sophiſters and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, that workes doe abſolutely iuſtifie, and that rewardes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to morall workes, but to faithfull workes onely.</p>
                     <p>Let vs therefore ſuffer the holy Ghoſt to ſpeake as he doth in the Scriptures, either of naked, ſimple, &amp; abſolute faith,<note place="margin">Faith ſimple, Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</note> or of compound and incarnate faith. All thinges which are attributed to workes doe properly belong vnto faith. For workes muſt not be looked vpon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but faithfully and with a ſpirituall eie. Faith is the diuinitie of workes, and is ſo ſpread throughout the workes of the faithfull, as is the diuinitie throughout the humanitie of Chriſt.

For the lawe is not of faith. And here <hi>Paule</hi> excludeth workes and the lawe, as things contrary to faith.</p>

This gloſe they them ſelues haue forged, and by the ſame they doe iniurie to the wordes of the Prophet. If they did call this formed or furniſhed faith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true faith which the Goſpell teacheth, this their gloſe ſhould nothing at all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me, for then faith ſhould not be ſeparated from charitie, but from the vaine opinion of faith:<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betvvene a true and a falſe faith.</note> As we alſo put a difference betwene a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit faith and a true faith.

The morall philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher is much better, then the hypocrite hauing ſuch a faith.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, if they would make a diſtinction betwene their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med faith and a falſe or counterfeit faith (as I haue ſaid) their diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould not offend me.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> therefore calleth them onely righteous,<note place="margin">VVho they are that Paule calleth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</note> which are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied through the promiſe, or through faith in the promiſe, without the lawe.

In deede it is true, that a man doing the workes of the law, ſhall liue in them: that is, ſhall be bleſſed: but ſuch a one can not be founde. Now, ſeeing there is a double vſe of the lawe,<note place="margin">A double vſe of the lavve.</note> the one po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike and the other ſptrituall, he that will vnderſtande this ſentence ciuilly, may doe it after this ſorte: <hi>He that shall doe thoſe thinges shall liue in them:</hi> that is, if a man obey the magiſtrate outwardly and in the politike gouernment, he ſhall auoid puniſhment and death: For the ciuill magiſtrate hath no power ouer him. This is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike vſe of the lawe, which ſerueth to bridle thoſe that are rude and vntractable. But <hi>Paule</hi> here ſpeaketh not of this vſe, but entreateth of this place like a Diuine: therefore there is a condition neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly included. As if he ſaide: If men could keepe the lawe, they ſhould be happy. But where are they? They are not therfore Doers of the lawe, except they be firſt made righteous before and without the lawe through faith.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, when <hi>Paule</hi> curſeth and condemneth thoſe that are of the works of the law, he ſpeaketh not of ſuch as are iuſtified through faith,<note place="margin">The imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ierome, vnderſtanding Paule as though he ſpake of the lavv but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and as it is ſeparate from faith.</note> but of ſuch as goe about to be iuſtified by works without faith in Chriſt. This I ſay leſt any man ſhould follow the fond imagination of <hi>Ierome,</hi> who being deceaued by <hi>Origene,</hi> vnderſtoode nothing at all in <hi>Paule,</hi> but onely conſidered of him as a meere ciuill Lawyer. Hereupon he reaſoneth after this manner: The holy Patriarches, Prophetes, and Kinges were circumciſed and offered ſacrifice: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they obſerued the law. But it were a wicked thing to ſay, that they
<pb facs="tcp:9456:136"/>
are vnder the Curſe: therfore all they that are of the works of the law are not vnder the Curſe. Thus he fighteth againſt <hi>Paule</hi> without all iudgement, making no difference betwene the true doers of the law iuſtified by faith, and thoſe workers which ſeeke to be iuſtified by the lawe without faith.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh here nothing at all againſt thoſe that are iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtified by faith, and are true doers of the law in deede, for they are not of the workes of the law: but againſte thoſe which, not onely doe not keepe the law, but alſo ſinne againſt the ſame. For the law commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that we ſhould feare, loue, &amp; worſhip God with a true faith. This they doe not,<note place="margin">A picture of al Hypocrites.</note> but chooſe out new kindes of worſhip and workes which were neuer commaunded of God, by which God is not pacified, but more prouoked to anger,<note place="margin">Mat 15.9.</note> according to that ſaying: <hi>They vvorship me in vaine vvith the commaundementes of men.</hi> Therefore they are full of impietie, rebelles againſt God, and idolaters, ſinning greuouſly againſt the firſt commaundement aboue all the reſt. Moreouer, they haue alſo wicked concupiſcence and other greate paſſions. Briefely there is no good thing in them, but that outwardly they would ſeeme to be righteous, and would haue men to thinke that they doe the law.</p>
                  <p>So we alſo which are made righteous by faith, as were the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches, Prophetes and all the Sainctes, are not of the works of the law as concerning the matter of iuſtification. But in that we are in the fleſh, and haue as yet the remnauntes of ſinne in vs, we are vnder the law, &amp; yet not vnder the Curſe, becauſe the remnaunts of ſinne are not imputed vnto vs for Chriſtes ſake in whom we beleue. For the fleſh is an enemy vnto God, &amp; that concupiſcence which yet remaineth in vs, not onely fulfilleth not the law, but alſo ſinneth againſt the ſame, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt vs and leading vs captiue into bondage. <hi>Rom. 7.</hi> Now, if the law be not fulfilled in the Sainctes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom. 7.23.</hi> Remnauntes of ſinne in the Sainctes, and in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of God.</note> but that many things are done in them contrary to the law, if euill concupiſcence and the remnauntes of ſinne are yet remaining in them, which doe ſo hinder them that they can not feare and loue God, they can not call vpon God with aſſured truſt, they can not praiſe God and reuerence his worde as they ſhould do: much more is this true in a man which is not yet iuſtified by faith, but is an enemy vnto God, and with all his hearte deſpiſeth and hateth the worde and worke of God. Ye ſee then that <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh here of ſuch as will fulfill the law and be iuſtified thereby, although they haue not yet receaued faith, and not of the fathers and Saincts (as <hi>Ierome</hi> imagineth) which are iuſtified by faith already.</p>

For to ouercome the ſinne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, death, the Curſe and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God in himſelfe, is not the worke of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but of the diuine power. Therefore he which <hi>in him ſelfe</hi> ſhould ouercome theſe, muſt needes be truly and naturally God. For againſt this mightie power of ſinne, death and the curſe (which of it ſelfe reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth throughout the world and in the whole creature) it was neceſſary to ſet a more high and mightie power. But beſides the ſoueraigne and diuine power, no ſuch power can be found. Wherfore, to aboliſh ſinne, to deſtroy death, to take away the curſe <hi>in himſelfe:</hi> and againe, to geue righteouſnes, to bringe life to light, and to geue the Bleſſing, are the workes of the diuine power onely and alone. Now becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth attribute all theſe to Chriſte, therefore he in him ſelfe is life, righteouſnes and Bleſſing, which is naturally and ſubſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God. Wherefore they that denye the Diuinitie of Chriſt,<note place="margin">They become Turkes and Gentiles vvhich denie the Diuinitie of Chriſt.</note> doe loſe all Chriſtianitie and become altogether Gentiles and Turkes. We muſt learne therfore diligently the Article of iuſtification (as I often admoniſh you).

Therefore he was made a Curſe in deede accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:9456:140"/>
to the lawe, not for him ſelfe, but as (<hi>Paule</hi> ſayeth) for vs. For vnleſſe he had taken vpon himſelfe my ſinnes and thine, and the ſinnes of the whole world, the law had had no right ouer him, which condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth none but ſinners onely, and holdeth them vnder the Curſe.<note place="margin">Chriſt tooke our ſinnes of his ovvne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to be made a Curſe for them.</note> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he coulde neither haue ben made a Curſe nor die, ſith the onely cauſe of the Curſe and of Death is ſinne, from the which he was free. But becauſe he had taken vpon him our ſinnes, not by conſtraint, but of his owne good wil, it behoued him to beare the puniſhment &amp; wrath of God: not for his owne perſon (which was iuſt and inuincible, and therfore could be found in no wiſe giltie) but for our perſon.</p>
                  <p>So making a happie chaunge with vs, he tooke vpon him our ſinnefull perſon, and gaue vnto vs his innocente and victorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Wherwith we being now clothed, are freed from the Curſe of the lawe: for Chriſt was willingly made a Curſe for vs, ſaying: As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching mine owne perſon, I am bleſſed, and neede nothing. But I will put of mine owne perſon, and will put vppon me your perſon and your apparell: that is, your humane nature,<note place="margin">Philip. 2.7.</note> and will walke in the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and will ſuffer Death to deliuer you from Death. Nowe, he thus bearing the ſinne of the whole world in our perſon, was taken, ſuffered, was crucified and put to death, &amp; became a Curſe for vs. But becauſe he was a perſon diuine and euerlaſting, it was impoſſible that death ſhould holde him. Wherefore he roſe againe the third day from death, and now liueth for euer: and there is neither ſinne, nor death, nor our ſhape founde in him any more, but meere righteouſnes, life and euerlaſting bleſſednes.</p>
                  <p>This image and this myrrour we muſt haue continually before vs, and beholde the ſame with a ſtedfaſt eye of Faith. He that doth ſo, hath this innocencie and victory of Chriſt, although he be neuer ſo great a ſinner. By Faith onely therefore we are made righteous,<note place="margin">Faith onely layeth holde vpon the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of Chriſte.</note> for Faith layeth hold vpon this innocencie &amp; this victorie of Chriſt. Loke then howe much thou beleueſt this, ſo much thou doeſt enioy it. If thou beleeue ſinne, death, and the Curſe to be aboliſhed, they are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. For Chriſt hath vanquiſhed and taken away theſe in him ſelfe, and will haue vs to beleue, that like as in his owne perſon there is now no appearaunce of a ſinner nor token of death, euen ſo is there none in ours, ſeeing he hath performed all things for vs.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, if ſinne vexe thee and death terrifie thee, thinke that it is (as it is in deede) but an imagination, &amp; a falſe illuſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Deuil. For in very deede there is now no Sinne, no Curſe, no Death, no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

Therefore the victorie of Chriſt is moſt certaine, and there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the thing it ſelfe, ſince it is moſt true, but in our incredulitie: for it is a hard matter to reaſon to beleeue theſe ineſtimable good things and vnſpeakeable riches.

                  <p>And that there is in deede no more ſinne, death, or malediction, ſince Chriſt nowe raigneth: we confeſſe daily in the Creede of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: <hi>I beleue that there is an holy Church.</hi>

For they which do beleue in Chriſt, are no ſinners, are not giltie of death, but are holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, lordes ouer ſinne and death, &amp; liuing for euer. But Faith onely ſeeth this: for we ſay, I beleeue an holy Church. But if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue reaſon and thine owne eyes, thou wilt iudge cleane contrary. For thou ſeeſt many things in the Godly which offend thee.<note place="margin">The vveaknes of the godly.</note> Thou ſeeſt them ſometime to fall into ſinne, and to be weake in Faith, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto wrath, enuie, and ſuch other euill affections: therefore the Church is not holy. I deny the conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. If I looke vpon mine owne perſon, or the perſon of my brother, it ſhall neuer be holy. But if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſt, who hath ſanctified and clenſed his Church, then is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together holy: for he hath taken away the ſinnes of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Therfore, where ſinnes are ſeene and felt, there are they in deede no ſinnes.

Contrariwiſe, according to Philoſophie and reaſon, ſinne, death, and the Curſe, are no where elſe but in the world, in the fleſh, or in ſinners.

He addeth moreouer an other propoſition:<note place="margin">By nature vve are all vnder the Curſe, but Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demed al that beleue in him.</note> Chriſt hath redemed vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Curſe of the law, being made a Curſe for vs: It followeth then that the lawe and workes doe not redeeme vs from the Curſe, but doe bring vs rather vnder the Curſe. Charitie therefore, (which, as the Schoolemen ſay, geueth forme and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto Faith) hath not onely not redemed vs from the Curſe, but rather it wrappeth vs more and more in the Curſe.</p>
                  <p>This text then is plaine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all men, yea the Apoſtles, Prophets, and Patriarks had remained vnder the Curſe, if Chriſt had not ſet him ſelfe againſt ſinne, death, the Curſe of the law, the wrath and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, and ouercome them in his owne body: for no power of fleſh and bloud could ouercome theſe huge and hideous Monſters. But now, Chriſt is not the law or the worke of the law, but a diuine and humane perſon, which tooke vpon him ſinne, the condemnation of the lawe and death, not for him ſelfe, but for vs. Wherfore all the weight and force hereof conſiſteth in this word, <hi>For vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imagine Chriſt to be innocent &amp; as a priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (as doe the Schoolemen, and almoſt all the Fathers haue done) which is holy and righteous for him ſelfe onely.<note place="margin">All men, yea the moſt holy, remaine vnder the Curſe, vvithout Chriſt.</note> True it is in deede that Chriſte is a perſon moſt pure and vnſpotted: but thou muſt not ſtay there: for thou haſt not yet Chriſte, although thou knowe him to be God and man: but then thou haſt him in deede, when thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt that this moſt pure and innocent perſon is freely geuen vnto thee of the Father to be thy high Prieſt and Sauiouer,<note place="margin">Hovve Chriſt is truely knovven.</note> yea rather thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, that he putting off his innocentie and holines, and taking thy
<pb facs="tcp:9456:142"/>
ſinnefull perſon vpon him, might beare thy ſinne, thy death, and thy Curſe, and might be made a ſacrifice and a Curſe for thee, that by this meanes he might deliuer thee from the Curſe of the lawe.</p>
                  <p>Ye ſee then with what an Apoſtolike ſpirite <hi>Paule</hi> handleth this argument of the Bleſſing and of the Curſe, whileſt he not onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Chriſt ſubiect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Curſe, but ſayth alſo that he is made a Curſe. So in the. 2. Corrin. 5. he calleth him Sinne, when he ſayth: <hi>He hath made him to be Sinne for vs, vvhich knevv no ſinne, that vve shoulde be made the righteouſnes of God in him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.25.</note> And although theſe ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be well expounded after this maner: Chriſt is made a Curſe, that is to ſay, a ſacrifice for the Curſe: and Sinne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, a ſacrifice for ſinne,<note place="margin">Chriſt is made a Curſe and ſinne for vs.</note> yet in my iudgement it is better to keepe the proper ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words, becauſe there is a greater force and vehemencie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For when a ſinner cometh to the knowledge of him ſelfe in deede, he feeleth not onely that he is miſerable, but miſery it ſelfe: not onely that he is a ſinner &amp; is accurſed, but euen ſinne and malediction it ſelfe. For it is in deede a great matter to beare ſinne, the wrath of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction and death. Wherefore that man which hath a true feeling of theſe things (as Chriſt did truely &amp; effectually feele them for all ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde) is made euen ſinne, death, and malediction it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> therefore handleth this place with a true Apoſtolicall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. There is neither Sophiſter, nor Lawyer, nor Iew, nor Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, nor any other that ſpeaketh as he doeth. For who durſt alleage this place out of <hi>Moiſes: Accurſed is euery one that hangeth on tree,</hi> and applie it vnto Chriſt? Like as <hi>Paule</hi> then applied this ſentence to Chriſt, euen ſo may we apply vnto Chriſte, not onely that whole. 27. chap. of Deuteronomie, but alſo may gather all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Curſes of <hi>Moiſes</hi> lawe together, and expound the ſame of Chriſt. For as Chriſt is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in this generall lawe, touching his owne perſon, ſo is he alſo in all the reſt.<note place="margin">All the curſes of the lavve be laid vpon Chriſt.</note> And as he is giltie in this generall lawe in that he is made a Curſe for vs, and is hanged vpon the croſſe as a wicked man, a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, a murtherer &amp; a traitour: euen ſo is he alſo giltie in all others. For all the Curſes of the law are heaped together and laide vpon him, and therfore he did beare and ſuffer them in his owne body for vs. He was therfore not onely accurſed, but was alſo made a Curſe for vs.</p>
                  <p>This is rightly and after a true Apoſtolicall manner to interprete the Scriptures. For a man is not able to ſpeake after this manner without the holy Ghoſt: that is to ſay, to comprehend the whole lawe in this one ſaying: <hi>Chriſt is made a Curſe for vs,</hi> and lay the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:9456:142"/>
vpon Chriſte:<note place="margin">This is a moſt ſure argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t taken out of the vvhole lavve.</note> and contrariwiſe to comprehend all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Scripture, and ſay, that they are all at once fulfilled in Chriſt. Wherfore this is in deede an Apoſtolike and inuincible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not taken out of one place of the lawe, but out of the whole lawe: which <hi>Paule</hi> alſo vſeth as a ſure ground.</p>
                  <p>Here we may ſee with what diligence <hi>Paule</hi> read the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and howe exactly he wayed euery worde of this place:<note place="margin">Paule diligent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly vvayeth this ſentence of Geneſis: In thy ſeede. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>In thy ſeede shall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> Firſt, out of this worde Bleſſing. &amp;c. he gathereth this argument: If bleſſing ſhall be geuen vnto all nations, then are all nations vnder the Curſe, yea the Iewes alſo, who haue the lawe. And he alleageth a teſtimonie of the Scripture, wherby he proueth that all the Iewes which are vnder the lawe, are vnder the Curſe: <hi>For Curſed is euery one vvhich abideth not in all the things that are vvritten in this booke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer, he diligently wayeth this clauſe: <hi>All nations.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">All nations.</note> Out of the which he gathereth thus: that the Bleſſing belongeth not onely to the Iewes, but alſo to all the nations of the whole world. Seing then it belongeth to all nations, it is impoſſible that it ſhould be obtained through the lawe of <hi>Moiſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Ievves attained not to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes through the lavve. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</note> for as much as there was no nation y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had the law, but onely the Iewes. And although they had the law, yet were they ſo farre of from obtaining the Bleſſing through it, that the more they indeuoured to accompliſh it, the more they were ſubiecte to the Curſe of the lawe. Wherfore there muſt needes be an other righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which muſt be farre more excellent then the righteouſnes of the law, through which, not onely the Iewes, but alſo all nations through out the whole world, muſt obtaine the Bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>Finally, theſe words: <hi>In thy Seede,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In thy ſeede.</note> he expoundeth after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that a certaine man ſhould iſſue out of the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is to ſay, Chriſt, through whom the Bleſſing ſhould come afterwards vpon all nations.<note place="margin">Chriſt became accurſed, that he might bleſſe all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Seing therfore it was Chriſte that ſhould bleſſe all nations, it was he alſo that ſhould take away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Curſe from them. But he could not take it away by the law, for by the lawe it is more &amp; more encreaſed. What did he then? He ioyned himſelf to the companie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> accurſed, taking vnto him their fleſh and their bloud, and ſo ſet him ſelf for a Mediator betwene God and men, ſaying:<note place="margin">Hovv the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vvere deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Curſe. In one perſon Chriſt ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together.</note> Although I be fleſh and bloud, and now dwell among the accurſed, yet notwithſtanding I am that Bleſſed one through whom all men muſt be bleſſed. So in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he ioyned God and man together, and being vnited vnto vs which were accurſed, he was made a Curſe for vs, &amp; hid his Bleſſing in our
<pb facs="tcp:9456:143"/>
ſinne, in our death, and in our Curſe, which condemned him and put him to death. But becauſe he was the Sonne of God, he coulde not be holden of them,<note place="margin">Hypocrites are offended at the doctrin of the goſpell.</note> but ouercame them, led them captiue and triumphed ouer them: and whatſoeuer did hang vpon fleſh, which for our ſake he tooke vpon him, he caried it with him. Wherefore all they that cleaue vnto this fleſh, are bleſſed and deliuered from the Curſe, that is, from ſinne, and euerlaſting death.</p>
                  <p>They that vnderſtand not this benefite of Chriſt (wherof the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſpecially intreateth) and knowe not an other righteouſnes beſides the righteouſnes of the lawe, when they heare that the workes of the lawe are not neceſſary to ſaluation, but that men doe obtaine the ſame by onely hearing and beleuing that Chriſte the Sonne of God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon him our fleſh and ioyned him ſelfe to the accurſed, to the ende that all natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s might be bleſſed, they (I ſay) are offended: for of all this they vnderſtand nothing, or elſe they vnderſtand it carnally. For their mindes are occupied with other cogitations &amp; fantaſtical imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: therfore theſe things ſeeme vnto them ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge matters. Yea euen vnto vs which haue receaued the firſt fruites of the ſpirit, it is vnpoſſible to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d theſe things perfectly: for they mightely fight agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt reaſon.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, all euils ſhould haue ouerwhelmed vs, as they ſhall ouerwhelme the wicked for euer. But Chriſt being made for vs a tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of all lawes, giltie of all our malediction, our ſinnes, and al our euils, cometh as Mediatour betwene, embracing vs wicked and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſinners. He tooke vpon him and bare all our euils, which ſhould haue oppreſſed and tormented vs for euer: and theſe caſte him downe for a while, and ranne ouer his head like water, as the Prophet in the perſon of Chriſt complaineth when he ſayth: <hi>Thy indignation ſore preſſeth me,</hi>

                     <hi>and thou haſt vexed me vvith all thy ſtormes.</hi> Again: <hi>Thine indignations haue gone ouer me, and thy terrours haue trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me.</hi> By this meanes we being deliuered from theſe euerlaſting terrours and anguiſh through Chriſte, ſhall enioy an euerlaſting and ineſtimable peace and felicitie, ſo that we beleue this.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the reuerend myſteries and ſecretes, which <hi>Moiſes</hi> alſo ſomwhat parkly in ſome places did for eſhew:<note place="margin">The true my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.

A man (ſayth he) is able to loue God aboue all things, for he loueth him ſelf aboue all things: therfore much more is he able to loue God aboue all things. For a good thing the greater it is, the more it is to be loued. And hereof he inferreth that a man is able, <hi>ex puris naturalibus:</hi> that is to ſay, euen of his owne pure natural ſtrength, eaſily to fulfil that high commaundement: <hi>Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God vvith all thy heart. &amp;c.</hi> For (ſayth he) a man is able to loue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt good thing aboue all thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs: yea he ſetteth at naught his life (of all other things moſt deare vnto him) for a litle vile money: Therfore he can much more doe it for Gods cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Ye haue oftentimes heard of me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ciuill ordinaunces are of God: for God hath ordained them and alloweth them, as he doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sunne, the Moone, &amp; other creatures.

If the law aboliſh the promiſe, then it followeth, that we by our works make God a lier and his promiſe of none effect. For if the law doe iuſtifie vs and deliver vs from ſinne and death, and conſequently our workes and our owne ſtrength performing the lawe, then the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> is vtterly voide and vnprofitable, and ſo conſequently God is a lier and a diſſembler.<note place="margin">VVhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovve if the lavve should abolish the promiſe.</note> For when he which promiſeth will not performe his promiſe, but maketh it of none effect, what doth he els but ſhew himſelfe to be a lier and a diſſembler? But it is impoſſible that the lawe ſhould make God a lier, or that our workes ſhould make the promiſe void, nay rather it muſt needes be firme &amp; ſtable for euer (for God promiſeth not in vaine) although we were able to keepe and fulfil the lawe.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:9456:147"/>
that they ſhould not neede the promiſe (which notwithſtanding is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible): yet muſt we thinke that the ſame promiſe abideth moſt ſure and certaine: or elſe God ſhould be found a lier, which either hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in vaine, or elſe wil not or can not performe his promiſes. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, like as the promiſe was before the lawe, ſo is it farre more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the lawe.</p>
                  <p>And God did excellently well in that he gaue the promiſe ſo long before the law.

For if he would that we ſhould haue ben iuſtified by the lawe, then would he haue geuen the law. 430. yeares before the promiſe, or elſe together with the promiſe. But nowe at the firſt he ſpeaketh not a worde as concerning the lawe, but at the length after 430. yeares he geueth the lawe. In the meane while, all that time he ſpeaketh onely of his promiſes. Therfore the Bleſſing and free gift of righteouſnes came before the lawe through the promiſe: The promiſe therfore is farre more excellent then the lawe. And ſo the law doth not aboliſh the promiſe, but Faith in the promiſe (whereby the beleuers euen before Chriſtes time were ſaued) which is now publiſhed by the Goſpell throughout the whole world, deſtroyeth the law, ſo that it can not encreaſe ſinne any more, terrifie ſinners, or bring them into deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, laying hold vpon the promiſe through Faith.</p>
                  <p>And in this alſo lieth a certaine vehemencie ſpecially to be noted, that he expreſſely ſetteth downe the number of .430. yeares.

And that the matter may be better vnderſtand, I will declare the ſame by a ſimilitude.<note place="margin">A Similitude.</note> If a rich man, not conſtrained, but of his owne good will, ſhould adopte one to be his ſonne, whom he knoweth not, and to whom he oweth nothing, and ſhould appoynt him to be the heire of all his lands and goods, &amp; certaine yeres after that he hath beſtowed this benefite vpon him, he ſhould lay vpon him a law to do this or that: he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not now ſay that he hath deſerued this benefite by his owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, ſeeing that many yeres before, he aſking nothing, had receaued the ſame freely and of mere fauour: So, God could not reſpect our workes and deſertes going before righteouſnes: for the promiſe and the gift of the holy Ghoſt was .430. yeares before the lawe.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it appeareth that <hi>Abraham</hi> obteined not righteouſnes before God through the lawe.<note place="margin">Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvas not made righteous by the lavve, for vvhen he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ther vvas no lavve.</note> For there was yet no law. If there were yet no lawe, then was there neither worke nor merite. What then? Nothing elſe but the mere promiſe. This promiſe <hi>Abraham</hi> beleued, and it was counted to him for righteouſnes. By the ſelfe ſame meanes then that the father obteined this promiſe, the children doe alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine it and holde it. So ſay we alſo at this day: Our ſinnes were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the death of Chriſt aboue a thouſand and fiue hundreth yeres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, when there were yet no religious Orders, no Canon or rule of Penance, no merites of congruence and worthines. We can not nowe therfore begin to aboliſh the ſame by our owne workes and merites.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">VVhat maner of arguments Paule vſeth.</note>Thus <hi>Paule</hi> gathereth arguments of ſimilitudes, of a certaine time, and of perſons, ſo ſure &amp; ſtrong on euery ſide that no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them. Let vs therfore arme and fortifie our conſciences with ſuch like arguments: For it helpeth vs excedingly, to haue them alwayes ready in tentations. For they lead vs from the lawe and workes, to the promiſe and to faith: from wrath to grace: from ſinne to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, and from death to life. Therfore theſe two things (as I doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeate): to witte, the lawe and the promiſe muſt be diligently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed. For in time,<note place="margin">The lavv and the promiſe muſt be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</note> in place, and in perſon, and generally in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtances they are ſeparate as farre aſunder as heauen and earth, the beginning of the world and the later ende. In deede they are neare neighbours, for they are ioyned together in one man or in one ſoule: but in the inward affection &amp; as touching their office, they ought to be ſeparate farre aſonder: ſo that the lawe may haue dominion ouer the fleſh, and the promiſe may ſweetely and comfortably raigne in the conſcience. When thou haſt thus appoynted vnto them both their own
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:9456:148"/>
proper place, then thou walkeſt ſafely betwene them both in the heauen of the promiſe, and in the earth of the lawe.<note place="margin">Both the lavv and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe muſt haue their ovvne proper places appoynted vnto them.</note> In ſpirite thou walkeſt in the Paradiſe of grace and peace: In the fleſh thou walkeſt in the earth of workes and of the croſſe. And nowe the troubles which the fleſh is compelled to beare, ſhall not be hard vnto thee, becauſe of the ſweetenes of the promiſe, which comforteth and reioyceth the hart excedingly. But now, if thou confound and mingle theſe two together,<note place="margin">VVhat incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovve of the mingling of the lavve and the promiſe together.</note> and place the lawe in the conſcience, and the promiſe of libertie in the fleſh, then thou makeſt a confuſion, (ſuch as was in Poperie): ſo that thou ſhalt not knowe what the lawe, what the promiſe, what ſinne, or what righteouſnes is.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore if thou wilt diuide the worde of truth aright, thou muſt put a great difference betwene the promiſe and the lawe as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the inward affections and whole practiſe of life.<note place="margin">The promiſe muſt not be confounded vvith the lavve.</note> It is not for naught that <hi>Paule</hi> proſecuteth this argument ſo diligently. For he foreſawe in ſpirite that this miſchiefe ſhould creepe into the Church, that the word of God ſhould be confounded: that is to ſay, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhould be mingled with the lawe, and ſo the promiſe ſhould be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt. For when the promiſe is mingled with the lawe, it is nowe made nothing elſe but the very lawe. Therefore accuſtome thy ſelfe to ſeparate the promiſe and the law aſunder, euen in reſpect of time, that when the lawe cometh and accuſeth thy conſcience, thou mayeſt ſay: Lady lawe, thou comeſt not in ſeaſon, for thou comeſt to ſoone. Tarry yet vntil .430. yeres be expired, and when they are paſt, then come and ſpare not. But if thou come then, yet ſhalt thou come to late. For then hath the promiſe preuented thee .430. yeres: to the which I aſſent and ſweetely repoſe my ſelfe in the ſame. Therefore I haue nothing to doe with thee: I heare thee not. For nowe I liue with the beleuing <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> or rather ſince Chriſte is nowe reuealed and geuen vnto me, I liue in him: who is my righteouſnes, who alſo hath aboliſhed thee, O lawe. And thus let Chriſte be alwayes before thine eyes, as a certaine Summarie of all argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for the defence of Faith, againſt the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of the fleſh, againſt the lawe, and againſt all workes and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites what ſo euer.</p>
                  <p>Hetherto I haue reherſed almoſt all, but ſpecially the principall arguments which the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> handleth in this Epiſtle for the confirmation of this Doctrine of Iuſtification. Among which,<note place="margin">The argument touching the promiſe.</note> the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument as touching the promiſe made vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> and to the other Fathers, is the waightieſt and of greateſt efficacie: which <hi>Paule</hi> doth

Finally, he declareth by the contrary what the lawe worketh:<note place="margin">The office of the lavve.</note> namely that it holdeth men vnder the Curſe. And thus he fortifieth the Article of Chriſtian righteouſnes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtrong and mighty arguments. On the other ſide, he ouerthroweth the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the falſe apoſtles which they vſed in defence of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of the lawe, and he turneth them vpon their owne heades: That is to ſay, wheras they contended that righteouſnes and life is obtained by the lawe, <hi>Paule</hi> ſheweth that they worke nothing but malediction and death in vs. Ye contend (ſayth he) that the law is neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.

                  <p>When we teach y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man is iuſtified w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the law and works, then doth this queſtion neceſſarily folow: If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law doe not iuſtifie, why then was it geuen? Alſo: Why doth God charge vs and burden vs with the lawe, if it doe not iuſtifie? What is the cauſe that we are ſo hardly exerciſed and vexed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it, if they which worke but one hower are made equal w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs, which haue borne the heate &amp; burden of the day? When as that grace is once publiſhed vnto vs which the Goſpell ſetteth out,<note place="margin">The murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves againſt the doctrine of Paule, for the ſtablishi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of faith. <hi>Math.</hi> 21.31.</note> by and by ariſeth this great murmuring: without the which the Goſpell can not be preached. The Iewes had this opinion, that if they kepte the lawe, they ſhould be iuſtified therby. Therefore when they heard that the Goſpell was preached concerning Chriſt, who came into the world to ſaue, not the righteous, but ſinners, &amp; that they ſhould goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:9456:150"/>
them into the kingdom of God, they were wonderfully offended, complaining that they had borne the heauy yoke of the lawe ſo many yeares with great labour and toyle, and that they were miſerably vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and oppreſſed with the tyrannie of the law, without any profit, yea rather to their great hurt: Againe, that the Gentiles who were Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, obteined grace w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any labour or trauell.<note place="margin">The murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes againſt the goſpell.</note> So doe our Papiſts murmur at this day, ſaying: What hath it profited vs that we haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in a Cloiſter twentie, thirtie, or fortie yeares: that we haue vowed chaſtitie, pouertie, obedience: that we haue ſayd ſo many Pſalters, and ſo many Canonical Howers, &amp; ſo many Maſſes: that we haue ſo puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed our bodies with faſting, prayers, chaſtiſements. &amp;c. if a huſband, a wife, a Prince, a gouernour, a maſter, a ſcholer: if an hireling or a drudge bearing ſackes, if a wench ſweeping the houſe ſhall not onely be made equall with vs, but alſo be accepted as better and more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy before God then we?</p>
                  <p>This is therfore an hard queſtion, wherewith reaſon is ſtricken dumme, and can not aunſwere, but is greatly offended with it. Reaſon after a ſorte vnderſtandeth the righteouſnes of the lawe,<note place="margin">The iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of reaſon, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning the doctrine of the Goſpell, vvhich tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that the lavve vvas geuen for tranſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. <hi>Galat. 3.19. Rom. 2.14. Rom. 6.1. Rom. 3.8.</hi>
                     </note> which alſo it teacheth and vrgeth, and imagineth that the doers of it are righteous: but it vnderſtandeth not the office and ende of the law. Therfore when it heareth this ſentence of <hi>Paule,</hi> which is ſtraunge and vnknowne to the world: <hi>That the lavve vvas geuen for tranſgreſsions,</hi> thus it iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth: <hi>Paule</hi> aboliſheth the lawe, for he ſayth, that we are not iuſtified through it: Yea he is a blaſphemer againſt God which gaue the lawe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayth: <hi>that the lavve vvas geuen for tranſgreſsions.</hi> Let vs liue therfore as Gentiles which haue no lawe. Yea, let vs ſinne &amp; abide in ſinne, that grace may abounde: Alſo, let vs doe euill, that good may come therof. This happened to the Apoſtle <hi>Paule:</hi> and the ſelfe ſame happeneth at this day vnto vs. For when the common people heare out of the Goſpell, that righteouſnes cometh by the mere grace of God through Faith onely, without the law and without workes, they gather by and by of it, as did the Iewes in times paſt: If the lawe doe not iuſtifie, then let vs worke nothing: and ſurely they performe this excellently well.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould we then doe? This impietie doth in deede very much vexe vs, but we can not remedie it. For when Chriſte preacheth, he muſt nedes heare,<note place="margin">Chriſt is iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be a blaſphemer, and a ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon.</note> that he was a blaſphemer and a ſeditious perſon: that is to ſay, that through his doctrine he deceaued men, and made them rebelles againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi> The ſelfe ſame thing happened to <hi>Paule</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:9456:150"/>
and all the reſt of the Apoſtles. And what maruell is it if the world in like maner accuſe vs at this day? Let it accuſe vs, let it ſclaunder vs, let it perſecute vs and ſpare not: yet muſt not we therefore hold our peace, but ſpeake freely, to the ende that afflicted conſciences may be deliuered out of the ſnares of the Deuill. And we muſt not regarde the fooliſh and vngodly people in that they do abuſe our doctrine: for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they haue a law or no lawe, they can not be reformed. But we muſt conſider how afflicted conſciences may be comforted, that they peariſh not with the multitude. If we ſhould diſſemble and holde our peace, pore afflicted conſciences ſhould haue no conſolation, which are ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and ſnared with mens lawes and traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that they can wind them ſelues out by no meanes.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Paule</hi> therefore ſeeing ſome to ſet themſelues againſt his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and others ſome to ſeeke the libertie of the fleſh and therby to be made worſe, comforted him ſelfe after this ſort, that he was an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt ſent to preach the Faith of Gods elect, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he muſt ſuffer all things for the elects ſake,<note place="margin">All things are to be done for the elects ſake</note> to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they alſo might obtaine ſaluation: euen ſo we at this day do al things for the elects ſake, whom we know to be edified &amp; comforted through our doctrine. But as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dogges &amp; ſwine (of whom the one ſort doth perſecute our doctrine,<note place="margin">Dogges. Hogges.</note> and the other ſort doth tread vnder foote y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> libertie which we haue in Chriſt Ieſus) I am ſo offended with them, that in all my life for their ſakes I would not vtter ſo much as one word: but I would rather wiſh that theſe hogges, together with our aduerſaries the dogges, were yet ſtill ſubiect to the Popes tyrannie, rather then that the holy name of God ſhould be ſo blaſphemed and euill ſpoken of through them.</p>
                  <p>Therfore, albeit not onely the fooliſh &amp; ignorant people, but they alſo which ſeeme in their owne conceits to be very wiſe, do argue after this ſort: If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law do not iuſtifie, then is it in vaine &amp; vnprofitable,<note place="margin">The lavv iuſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fieth not, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, is a naughtie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</note> yet is it not therfore true. For like as this conſequence is nothing worth: Money doth not iuſtifie or make a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> righteous, therfore it is vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: the eyes do not iuſtifie, therfore they muſt be plucked out: the hands make not a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> righteous therfore they muſt be cut of: ſo is this naught alſo: The lawe dothe not iuſtify, therfore it is vnprofitable: for we muſt attribute vnto euery thinge his proper effect and vſe. We doe not therfore deſtroy &amp; condemne the lawe bicauſe we ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it doth not iuſtifie: but we anſwere otherwiſe to this queſtion: <hi>To vvhat end then ſerueth the lavv?</hi> then our aduerſaries doe, who doe wickedly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſely counterfet an office &amp; vſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law which belongeth not vnto it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9456:151"/>Againſt this abuſe and forged office of the lawe we diſpute and aunſwer with <hi>Paule,</hi> that the law doth not iuſtifie. But in ſo ſaying, we affirme not that the lawe is vnprofitable, as they doe by and by gather: If the law doe not iuſtifie (ſay they) then is it geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vaine. No not ſo. For it hath his proper office &amp; vſe,<note place="margin">The proper office and vſe of the lavve.</note> but not that which the aduerſaries do imagin, namely, to make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> righteous: but it accuſeth, terrifieth, and condemneth them. We ſay with <hi>Paule</hi> that the lawe is good, if a man doe rightly vſe it:<note place="margin">VVhen the lavve is good.</note> that is to ſay, if he vſe the law as the law. If I geue vnto the lawe his proper definition, and keepe it within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his office and vſe, it is an excellent thing: But if I tranſlate it to an other vſe, and attribute that vnto it which I ſhould not, then doe I not onely peruert the law, but alſo the whole Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Therfore <hi>Paule</hi> fighteth here againſt thoſe peſtilent hypocrites, who could not abide this ſentence: <hi>The lavve vvas added for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsions.</hi> For they thinke that the office of the lawe is to iuſtifie. And this is the generall opinion of mans reaſon amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Sophiſters,<note place="margin">Al men do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally iudge that the lavve doth iuſtifie.</note> and throughout the whole world, that righteouſnes is gotten through the workes of the lawe. And reaſon will by no meanes ſuffer this pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion to be wreſted from it, becauſe it vnderſtandeth not the righteouſnes of Faith.

For he can not beare the iudgement of God, his owne death and damnation: and yet notwithſtanding he can not eſcape them. Here he muſt needes fall into the hatred of God, and blaſphemie againſt God.

grace. For God is the God of the humble, the miſerable, the afflicted, the oppreſſed &amp; the deſperate, and of all thoſe that are vtterly brought to nothing:<note place="margin">A ſingular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Nay, the fooliſhnes of mans heart is ſo great, that in this conflict of conſcience, when the lawe hath done his office and exerciſed his true miniſterie,<note place="margin">Reaſon in the time of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation flieth not to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of grace, but to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the lavve.</note> he doth not onely not lay holde vpon the doctrine of grace, which promiſeth moſt aſſuredly the forgeuenes of ſinnes for Chriſtes ſake, but ſeeketh and procureth to him ſelfe moe lawes to ſatiſfie and quiet his conſcience. If I liue (ſayeth he) I will amend my life: I will doe this, I will doe that. Here, except thou doe the quite contrary: that is to ſay, except thou ſend <hi>Moiſes</hi> away with his law, to thoſe that

                  <p>So that lawe with his office doth helpe by occaſion to Iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that it driueth a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the promiſe of grace, and maketh the ſame ſweete &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable vnto him. Wherfore we doe not abrogate the law, but we ſhew the true office and vſe of the law: to witte, that it is a true and a profitable miniſter, which driueth a man to Chriſte. Therfore, after that the law hath humbled thee, terrified thee, and vtterly beaten thee downe, ſo that nowe thou art at the very brinke of deſperation, ſee that thou learne how to vſe the lawe rightly.<note place="margin">The lavv doth not onely shevv vnto a man his ſinne, but alſo dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him to Chriſt. <hi>Luke. 4.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Wherefore <hi>Paule</hi> here beginneth a freſh to entreat of the lawe, and defineth what it is, taking occaſion of that which he ſayd before: to witte, that the lawe iuſtifieth not. For reaſon hearing this, by and by doth thus inferre: Then God gaue the lawe in vaine. It was neceſſary therefore to ſeeke howe to define the lawe aright, and to ſhew what the lawe is, and howe it ought to be vnderſtand, that it be not taken more largely or more ſtraitly then it ſhould be. There is no law (ſayeth he) that is of it ſelfe neceſſary to iuſtification. Therefore when we reaſon as touching righteouſnes, life, and euerlaſting ſaluation, the lawe muſt be vtterly remoued out of our ſight, as if it had neuer bene, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhould be, but as though it were nothing at all. For in the matter of Iuſtification no man can remoue the lawe farre enough out of his ſight, or beholde the onely promiſe of God ſufficiently and as he ſhould do. Therfore I ſaid before that the law &amp; the promiſe muſt be ſeparate farre aſonder as touching the inward affections and the inward man, albeit in deede they are nerely ioyned together.</p>

The whole Mount was on a flaming fier. When the people ſawe this, they began to tremble: for they thought that they ſhould haue ben ſuddenly deſtroyed in this fearfull tempeſt. Becauſe therefore they could not abide the lawe ſounding ſo horribly out of Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> (for that terrifying voice of the lawe would haue killed the people) they ſayd vnto <hi>Moiſes</hi> their Mediatour: <hi>Come thou he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and heare vvhat the Lord ſayeth, and ſpeake thou vnto vs.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Moiſes a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.</note> And he aunſwered: <hi>I my ſelfe</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>vvas a Mediatour, and one that ſtoode betvvene God and you. &amp;c.</hi> By theſe places it is plaine enough that <hi>Moiſes</hi> was appoynted a Mediatour betwene the people, and the lawe ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore <hi>Paule</hi> by this hiſtorie goeth about to declare, that it is impoſſible that righteouſnes ſhould come by the lawe. As if he ſhould ſay: howe can the lawe iuſtifie, ſeeing the whole people of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> being purified and ſanctified, yea and <hi>Moiſes</hi> him ſelfe the Mediatour betwene God and the people, were afraide and trembled at the voice of the lawe, as it is ſayd in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes?<note place="margin">The lavv ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, therfore it iuſtifieth not.</note> Here was nothing but feare and trembling.

                  <p>So, when ſinne is diſcouered, as it were by certaine bright beames which the law ſtriketh into the heart,<note place="margin">Nothing is more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to man then the lavv,</note> there is nothing more odious &amp; more intolerable to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law is.

                     <hi>A Mediatour</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>is not a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of one onely:</hi> but this word neceſſarily comprehendeth two: that is to ſay, him that is offended, and him that is the offender: of whom, the one hath neede of interceſſion, and the other needeth none. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Mediatour is not of one, but of two, and of ſuch two as be at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaunce betwene them ſelues. So <hi>Moiſes</hi> by a generall definition is a Mediatour, becauſe he doth the office of a Mediatour betwene the law and the people, who can not abide the true and ſpirituall vſe of the law. The lawe therfore muſt haue a new face,<note place="margin">The lavve ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing put on a veile, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid.</note> and his voyce muſt be chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: that is to ſay, the voyce of the law muſt be made ſpirituall, or the lawe muſt be made liuely in the inward affection, and muſt put on a viſour or a veile, that it may now become more tolerable, ſo that the people may be able to heare it by the voice of <hi>Moiſes.</hi>

And yet notwithſtanding the one of theſe two muſt needes be done: to witte, that either the lawe muſt be without his vſe, and couered with a veile (but then, as I haue ſaid, it maketh hypocrites): or els it muſt be in his vſe without the veile,<note place="margin">The lavve in his true vſe killeth.</note> and then it killeth. For mans hearte can not abide the lawe in his true vſe, without the veile. It behoueth thee therefore, if thou looke to the ende of the law without the veile, either to laye holde on that bleſſed Seede by faith, (that is to ſay) thou muſt looke beyond the ende of the law vnto Chriſt, which is the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the law: which may ſay vnto thee: The law hath terrified thee enough: <hi>Be of good comfort my ſonne, thy ſinnes are forgeuen thee,</hi> (wherof I wil ſpeake more anone): or elſe ſurely thou muſt haue <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> for thy Mediatour, with his veile.</p>
                  <p>For this cauſe <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth: <hi>A mediatour is not a Mediatour of one.</hi> For it could not be that <hi>Moiſes</hi> ſhould be a Mediatour of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: For God needeth no Mediatour. And againe, he is not a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the people onely,<note place="margin">The office of a Mediatour.</note> but he doth the office of a Mediatour betwene God and the people, which were at diſcord with God. For it is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Mediatour to pacifie the partie that is offended, and to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile vnto him the partie which is the offender. Notwithſtanding <hi>Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> is a Mediatour in this ſort, as I haue ſayd: which doth nothing elſe but chaunge the voyce of the lawe, and maketh it tolerable, ſo that the people may abide the hearing thereof: but geueth no power to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the ſame. To conclude, he is a Mediatour but onely of the veile, and therfore he geueth no power to performe the law, but onely in the veile.<note place="margin">Moſes a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour of the veile.</note> Therefore his diſciples, in that he is a Mediatour of the veile, muſt alwayes be hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>But what (thinke ye) ſhould haue come to paſſe if that the lawe had bene geuen without <hi>Moiſes,</hi> either elſe before or after <hi>Moiſes,</hi> and that there had ben no Mediatour,<note place="margin">VVhen vve are terrified by the lavve, vve haue nede of another ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour then Moſes.</note> and in the meane ſeaſon the people ſhould not haue ben ſuffered either to flie away, or elſe to haue had any Mediatour? Here either the people being beaten downe with intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble feare, ſhould haue periſhed forthwith, or if they ſhould haue eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, there muſt nedes haue come ſome other Mediatour, which ſhould haue ſet him ſelfe betwene the law and the people to this end, that both the people might be preſerued, and the lawe remaine in his force and ſtrength, and alſo an attonement might be made betwene the lawe and the people. In deede <hi>Moiſes</hi> cometh in the meane ſeaſon, and is made a Mediatour: he putteth on a veile and couereth his face: but he can not deliuer mens conſciences from the anguiſh and terrour which the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9456:160"/>
law bringeth. Therefore, when a man, in the hower of death or in the conflict of conſcience feeleth the wrath and iudgement of God for ſinne which the law reuealeth and encreaſeth, here to keepe him from deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſecluding <hi>Moiſes</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his veile, he muſt haue a Mediatour which may ſay vnto him: Although thou be a ſinner, yet ſhalt thou remaine, that is to ſay: thou ſhalt not die, although the lawe with his wrath and malediction doe ſtill remaine.</p>
                  <p>This Mediatour is Ieſus Chriſt, which chaungeth not the voice of the law, nor hideth the ſame with a veile as <hi>Moiſes</hi> did,<note place="margin">Chriſt hideth not the lavv, but taketh it avvay, and therefore is a better Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour then Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> nor leadeth me out of the ſight of the law: but he ſetteth him ſelfe againſt the wrath of the law and taketh it away, and ſatiſfieth the lawe in his owne body by himſelfe. And by the Goſpel he ſaith vnto me: In deede the law threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto thee the wrath of God and eternall death: but be not afraid: flie not away, but ſtand ſtill. I ſupply and performe all thinges for thee: I ſatiſfie the law for thee. This is a Mediatour which farre excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Moiſes,</hi> who ſetteth him ſelfe betwene God being angry, and the ſinner. The interceſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> here profiteth nothing: he hath done his office, &amp; he w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his veile is now vaniſhed away. Here the miſerable ſinner being vtterly deſperate, or a man now approching vnto death, &amp; God being offended &amp; angry doe encounter together. Therefore there muſt come a farre other Mediatour then <hi>Moiſes,</hi> which may ſatiſfie the lawe, take away the wrath therof, and may reconcile vnto God which is angry, that poore ſinner, miſerable and gilty of eternall death.</p>
                  <p>Of this Mediatour <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh briefely when he ſaith:<note place="margin">A Mediatoure is he that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth betvvene the offender and him that is offended.</note> 
                     <hi>A Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour is not a Mediatour of one.</hi> For this word Mediatour proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifieth ſuch a one as doth the office of a Mediatour betwene the partie that is offended and the offender. We are the offenders: God with his law is he which is offended. And the offence is ſuch,<note place="margin">God of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice can not forgeue ſinne vvithout ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, vvhich is done by Chriſt.</note> that God can not pardon it, neither can we ſatiſfie for the ſame. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene God, who of him ſelfe is but one, and vs, there is wonderfull diſcord. Moreouer, God can not reuoke his law, but he will haue it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued and kept. And we which haue tranſgreſſed the law, can not flie from the preſence of God.<note place="margin">Chriſt is the Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvene God and ſinners, vvhich are quite contrary one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Col. 2.24.</hi>
                     </note> Chriſt therefore hath ſeth him ſelfe a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betwene two which are quite contrary and vtterly ſeparate aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with an infinite and euerlaſtinge ſeparation, and hath reconciled them together. And how hath he done this? <hi>He hath put avvay</hi> (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith in an other place) <hi>the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dvvriting vvhich vvas againſt vs, vvhich by ordinaunces</hi> (that is, by the law) <hi>vvas co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto vs, and he hath taken it and faſtened it to the Croſſe, and hath ſpoiled prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities
<pb facs="tcp:9456:161"/>
and povvers, and hath made a shevve of them openly, and hath triumphed ouer them by him ſelfe.</hi> Therefore he is not a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour of one, but of two, vtterly diſagreeing betweene them ſelues.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo a mighty place and of greate efficacie to confute and confounde the righteouſnes of the law, and to teach vs that in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Iuſtification it ought to be vtterly remoued out of our ſight. Alſo this word [Mediatour] miniſtreth ſufficient matter to proue that the lawe iuſtifieth not: for els what neede ſhould we haue of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour? Seing then that mans nature can not abide the hearinge of the lawe,<note place="margin">Man can not abide the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the lavv, therfore he can not keepe the lavv</note> much leſſe is it able to accompliſh the lawe, or to agree with the lawe.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine (which I doe ſo often repete and not without tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doe ſtill beate into your heades) is the true doctrine of the lawe, which euery Chriſtian ought with all diligence to learne,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the lavv.</note> that he may be able truly to define what the law is, what is the true vſe and office, what are the limites, what is the power, the time and the ende thereof. For it hath an effect quite contrary to the iudgement of all men: which haue this peſtilent and pernicious opinion naturally rooted in them, that the law iuſtifieth. Therefore I feare leſt this doctrine will be dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and defaced againe, when we are deade. For the world muſt be repleniſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> horrible darkenes &amp; errours before the latter day come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The proper vſe of the lavv</note>He therefore that is able to vnderſtand this, let him vnderſtand it, that the law in true Chriſtian Diuinitie, and in his true and proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition doth not iuſtifie: but hath a cleane contrary effect. For it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and diſcouereth vnto vs our ſelues: it ſetteth God before vs in his anger: it reueileth Gods wrath, it terrifieth vs, and it doth not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile ſinne, but alſo mightily encreaſeth ſinne, ſo that where ſinne was before but litle, now by the law which bringeth the ſame to light, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh exceeding ſinfull: ſo that a man now beginneth to hate the law and to flie from it, &amp; with a perfect hatred to abhorre God the maker of the law.

What is that? It bringeth men vnto the knowledge of themſelues: it diſcouereth and encreaſeth ſinne &amp;c. Here now riſeth an other obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

He ſaith not to <hi>Abraham:</hi> All nations ſhalbe bleſſed in thee becauſe thou haſt kept the law: but (as it is written in the .24. chap. of <hi>Ioſua</hi>) when he was yet vncircumciſed, had no law, &amp; was yet an idolater, he ſaid vnto him: <hi>Goe out of thine ovvne land &amp;c.

                     </note> Theſe are abſolute &amp; meere promiſes: which God freely geueth vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or reſpect of workes either going before or comming after.</p>
                  <p>This is ſpecially againſt the Iewes, which thinke that the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God are hindered becauſe of their ſinnes. God (ſaith <hi>Paule</hi>) doth not ſlacke his promiſes becauſe of our ſinnes, or haſten the ſame for our righteouſnes and merites: he regardeth neither the one nor the other. Wherefore, although we be worſe and more ſinnefull, and brought into a greater contempte and hatred of God by meanes of the lawes, yet notwithſtanding God is not moued therby to differre his promiſe. For his promiſe doth not ſtande vpon our worthines,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:9456:162"/>
but vpon his onely goodnes and mercy. Therefore, where the Iewes ſay: The Meſſias is not yet come, becauſe our ſinnes doe hinder his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, it is a deteſtable lie.<note place="margin">A Diuelish dreame of the Ievves.</note> As though God ſhould become vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous becauſe of our ſinnes, or made a lier becauſe we are liers. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth alwaies iuſt and true: his truth therefore is the onely cauſe that he accompliſheth and performeth his promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, although the law doe reueile and encreaſe ſinne, yet is it not againſt the promiſes of God, yea rather it confirmeth the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.<note place="margin">The lavve is not againſt the promiſes of God.</note> For as concerning his proper worke and ende, it humbleth and prepareth a man (ſo that he vſe it rightly) to ſigh and ſeeke for mercy. For when ſinne is reueiled to a man and ſo encreaſed by the law, then he beginneth to perceaue the wickednes and hatred of mans hearte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law, and againſt God him ſelfe the authour of the law. Then he feeleth in deede that, not only he loueth not God, but alſo hateth and blaſphemeth God who is full of goodnes &amp; mercy, and his lawe which is iuſt and holy. Then is he conſtrained to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that there is no good thing in him. And thus, when he is throwne downe and humbled by the lawe, he acknowledgeth him ſelfe to be moſt miſerable and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. When the law therfore conſtraineth a man ſo to acknowledge his owne corruption, and to confeſſe his ſinne from the bottome of his heart, then hath it done his office truely,<note place="margin">VVhen the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and time of the lavve is accomplished</note> and his time is accompliſhed and ended. And nowe is the time of grace, that the bleſſed Seede may come to raiſe vppe and to comfort him that is ſo caſt downe and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the lawe.</p>
                  <p>After this manner the law is not againſt the promiſes of God. For firſt the promiſe hangeth not vpon the lawe, but vpon the truth and mercy of God only and alone. Secondly when the law is in his chiefe end and office, it humbleth a man, and in humbling him it maketh him to ſigh and grone, and to ſeeke the hand and aide of the Mediatour, and maketh his grace and his mercy exceeding ſweete &amp; comfortable (as is ſaide <hi>Pſalm. 109. <hi>Thy mercy is ſvveete</hi>

is nothing els but ioy, conſolation and life. And there beginneth Chriſt and his benefite rightly to be knowne.</p>
                  <p>This is then the principall vſe of the law: namely, when a man can ſo vſe it, that it may humble him &amp; make him to thirſt after Chriſt.

For the lawes of the ceremonies were as well commaunded of God, and as ſtreitly kept as the morall lawes. The Iewes alſo kept circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as preciſely as they did the Sabboth day. It is euident enough therfore that <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh of the whole lawe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words of the Apoſtle are ſong &amp; ſaid in the Papacie and in all their churches, and yet notwithſtanding they both teach and liue quite contrary.<note place="margin">Paul teacheth that no lavve vvas geuen to bring life, but the Pope tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth quite contrary.</note> 
                     <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth ſimplie that no law was geuen to quicken and to bring life: but the Papiſtes teach that many lawes are geuen to bring life. Although they ſay not this in plaine words, yet in very deede ſuch is their opinion, as their Monkery doth plainely witnes, beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lawes and traditions of men, their workes and merites before grace and after, and innumerable wicked ceremonies and falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippings, which they haue deuiſed of their owne heads, and thoſe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue they preached, treading the Goſpell vnder their feete and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly promiſing grace, remiſſion of ſinnes, and life euerlaſting to all ſuch as ſhould kepe &amp; obſerue the ſame.

Therfore we put as great a difference betwene the law &amp; righteouſnes, as is betwene life &amp; death, betwene heauen &amp; hell. And the cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moueth vs ſo to affirme, is that plaine &amp; euident place of <hi>Paule:</hi> where he ſayth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the law is not geuen to iuſtifie, to geue life, and to ſaue, but onely to kil &amp; to deſtroy, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the opinion of all men:<note place="margin">The iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the lavve.</note> for naturally they can iudge no otherwiſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is geuen to work righteouſnes, &amp; to geue life &amp; ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>This difference of the offices of the law and the goſpel, kepeth all Chriſtian doctrine in his true &amp; proper vſe. Alſo it maketh a faithfull man iudge ouer all kindes of life, ouer the lawes &amp; decrees of all men,<note place="margin">VVhat profite cometh by knovving the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvene the lavve and the Goſpell.</note> and ouer all doctrine whatſoeuer, and it geueth them power to trie all maner of ſpirites. On the other ſide the Papiſts, becauſe they confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; mingle the law &amp; the goſpel together, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teach no certainty touching faith, works, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtates &amp; conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of life, nor of the difference of ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Now therfore, after that <hi>Paule</hi> hath proſecuted his confutations and arguments ſufficiently and in good order, he teacheth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe (if ye conſider his true and perfect vſe) is nothing elſe but as a certaine Scholemaſter to lead vs vnto righteouſnes.

<pb facs="tcp:9456:164"/>
proper worke and office, that is, when it maketh them giltie, terrifieth and bringeth them to the knowledge of ſinne, wrath, death and hell. For when it hath done this, the opinion of mans owne righteouſnes &amp; holines vaniſheth away, and Chriſte with his benefites beginneth to waxe ſweete vnto him.

Therefore neither the vowe nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Carthuſian, be it neuer ſo angelicall, is righteouſnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: for the Scripture hath ſhutte all vnder ſinne, all are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and damned.

                  <p>Briefly, what ſo euer is without Chriſt and his promiſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the lawe of God or the lawe of man, the Ceremoniall or the morall lawe, without all exception, is ſhut vnder ſinne: For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhutteth all vnder ſinne. Now, he that ſaith all, excepteth nothing. Therefore we conclude with <hi>Paule,</hi> that the policies and lawes of all nations, be they neuer ſo good and neceſſary, with all ceremonies and religions without faith in Chriſt, are and abide vnder ſinne, death and eternall damnation, except faith in Ieſus Chriſt goe withall or rather before all, as followeth in the texte. Of this matter we haue ſpoken largely before.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore this is a true propoſition:<note place="margin">Onely Faith iuſtifieth.</note> Onely faith iuſtifieth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works (which notwithſtanding our aduerſaries can by no meanes abide): For <hi>Paule</hi> here ſtrongly concludeth that the lawe geueth not life, becauſe it is not geuen to that ende.<note place="margin">If the lavv iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie not, much leſſe do vvorks iuſtify.</note> If then the lawe doe not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and geue life, much leſſe doe workes iuſtifie.

If then the law it ſelfe being fulfilled (although it be impoſſible that it ſhould be accompliſhed) doe not iuſtifie, much leſſe doe workes iuſtifie. I conclude therefore that faith onely iuſtifieth and bringeth life without workes. <hi>Paule</hi> can not ſuffer this addition: faith ioyned with works iuſtifieth: but he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſimplie by the negatiue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and before in the ſecond chapiter: <hi>Therefore by the vvorkes of the lavv</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>shall no flesh be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</hi>

For this ſhutting and holding vnder the lawe, muſt endure no longer, but vntill Faith come: and when Faith cometh, then muſt this ſpirituall priſon haue his ende.</p>

This <hi>Paule</hi> ſheweth when he ſayeth: <hi>VVe vvere kept vnder the lavv, and shutte vppe vnto the Faith vvhich should be reuealed vnto vs.</hi> Wherefore it is not enough that we are ſhutte vnder the lawe: for if nothing elſe ſhould follow, we ſhould be driuen to deſperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and die in our ſinnes.<note place="margin">The shutting vp vnder the lavv, muſt not be continuall.</note> But <hi>Paule</hi> addeth moreouer, that we are ſhutte vppe and kept vnder a Scholemaiſter (which is the lawe): not for euer, but to bring vs vnto Chriſt who is the ende of the lawe. Therefore this terrifying, this humbling and this ſhutting vppe muſt not alwayes continue: but onely vntill Faith be reuealed: that is, it ſhall ſo long continue as ſhall be for our profite and our ſaluation: So that when we are caſt downe and humbled by the lawe, then grace, remiſſion of ſinnes, deliueraunce from the lawe, ſinne and death may become ſweete vnto vs: which are not obteined by workes, but are receaued by Faith alone.</p>

                        </note> although he had nowe killed his brother: but diſſembled the matter craftely, and thought that God was ignoraunt thereof. <hi>Am I my brothers keeper,</hi> ſayth he? But when he heard this word: <hi>VVhat haſt thou done? Behold the voice of the bloud of thy brother crieth vnto me from the earth,</hi> he began to feele this priſon in deede. What did he then? He remained ſtill ſhutte vppe in priſon. He ioyned not the Goſpell with the lawe,<note place="margin">

for mercy and pardon. Therefore he deſpaired and denied God. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued not that he was ſhutte vppe to this end, that grace and Faith might be reuealed vnto him: but onely that he ſhould ſtill remaine in the priſon of the lawe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words: <hi>to be kept vnder, and to be shut vppe,</hi>

This keeping vnder and this priſon ſignifieth the true and ſpirituall terrours, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the conſcience is ſo ſhutte vppe, that in the wide world it can finde no place where it may be in ſafetie. Yea as long as theſe terrours en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, the conſcience feeleth ſuch anguiſh and ſorrowe, that it thinketh heauen and earth, yea if they were ten times more wide and large then they are, to be ſtraiter and narrower then a mouſe hole. Here is a man vtterly deſtitute of all wiſedome, ſtrength, righteouſnes, counſell and ſuccour. For the conſcience is a maruelous tender thing,<note place="margin">Conſcience.</note> and therfore when it is ſo ſhutte vppe vnder the priſon of the lawe, it ſeeth no way howe to gette out: and this ſtreitnes ſeemeth daily ſo to encreaſe, as though it would neuer haue an ende.

                     <p>Like as therefore this worldly priſon or ſhutting vppe is a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily affliction,<note place="margin">VVhat the pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon is, Ciuily &amp; Spiritually.</note> and he that is ſo ſhutte vppe can haue no vſe of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye: euen ſo the trouble and anguiſh of minde is a ſpirituall priſon, and he that is ſhutte vppe in this priſon can not enioy the quietnes of heart and peace of conſcience. And yet is it not ſo for euer (as reaſon iudgeth when it feeleth this priſon): but vntill Faith be reuealed. The ſely conſcience therefore muſt be raiſed vppe and comforted after this ſort: Brother, thou art in deede ſhutte vppe:<note place="margin">Hovv the pore Conſcience is to be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is shutte vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lavve.</note> but perſwade thy ſelfe that this is not done to the ende that thou ſhouldeſt remaine in this priſon for euer.

Deſpaire not therefore, as <hi>Caine, Saule,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> did, who being thus ſhutte vppe, looked no further but to their darke priſon, and there ſtill remained: therefore they deſpaired. But thou muſt take an other way in theſe terrours of conſcience then they did: that is, thou muſt knowe that it is well done, and good for thee to be ſo ſhut vppe, confounded, &amp; brought to nothing.

                     <p>This holding in priſon then vnder the lawe, muſt not alwayes endure, but muſt onely continue to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming or reuealing of Faith: which this ſweete verſe of the Pſalme. 147. doth teach vs: <hi>The Lord deliteth in thoſe that feare him:</hi>

By ſpeculation and naked knowledge a man may eaſily ioyne them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but by experience and inward practiſe ſo to doe, of all things it is the hardeſt: which I my ſelfe haue often proued by mine owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

the inward man. For that which is done as an hyſtorie and according to the time wherin Chriſte came, aboliſhing the lawe and bringing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie and eternall life to light, is alwayes done ſpiritually in euery Chriſtian: in whom is found continually, ſomewhile the time of the law, and ſomewhile the time of grace. For the Chriſtian man hath a body in whoſe members (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth in an other place) ſinne dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and warreth. Nowe, I vnderſtand ſinne to be,<note place="margin">Hovve the ſcripture defi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth ſinne.</note> not onely the deede or the worke, but alſo the roote and the tree, together with the fruites, as the Scripture vſeth to ſpeake of ſinne.

For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit a Chriſtian man doe not fall into outward and groſſe ſinnes,<note place="margin">The tentation of the godly.</note> as murther, adultery, theft, and ſuch like: yet is he not free from impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, murmuring, hating and blaſpheming of God: which ſinnes to reaſon and the carnall man, are altogether vnknowne.

For as carnall luſt is ſtrong in a yong man, in a man of full age the deſire and loue of glory, and in an old man couetouſnes: euen ſo in a holy and a faithfull man impatiencie, murmuring, hatred, and blaſphemie againſt God doe mightely preuaile.

                  <p>Both theſe times then (of the lawe and the Goſpell I meane) are in a Chriſtian, as touching the affections and inward man.

Here the law is in his true vſe and perfect worke: which a Chriſtian oftentimes feeleth as long as he liueth. So there was geuen vnto <hi>Paule a pricke in the flesh,</hi>

                     <hi>and vvhy doeſt thou trouble me?</hi> Doeſt thou ſee nothing but the lawe, ſinne, terrour, heauines, deſperation, death, hell and the Deuill? Is there not alſo grace, remiſſion of ſinnes, righteouſnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, ioy, peace, life, heauen, Chriſte and God? Trouble me no more, O my ſoule. What is the lawe, what is ſinne, what are all euils in compariſon of theſe things? Truſt in God, who hath not ſpared his owne deare ſonne, but hath geuen him to the death of the croſſe for thy ſinnes. This is then to be ſhutte vppe vnder the lawe after the fleſh: not for euer, but till Chriſte be reuealed. Therefore when thou art beaten downe,<note place="margin">The true vſe of the lavve is to shut vs vp till Chriſt be reuealed.</note> tormented and afflicted by the law, then ſay: Lady law, Thou art not alone, neither art thou all things: but beſides thee there are yet other things much greater and better then thou art, namely grace, faith, and bleſſing. This grace, this faith and this bleſſing doe not accuſe me, terrifie me, condemne me: but they comfort me, they bid me truſt in the Lord, and promiſe vnto me victorie and ſaluation in Chriſte. There is no cauſe therfore why I ſhould deſpaire.</p>
                  <p>He that is ſkilfull in this arte and this cunning, may in deede be called a right Diuine.<note place="margin">VVho is a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght diuine.</note> The fantaſticall ſpirites &amp; their diſciples at this day, which continually bragge of the ſpirite, do perſwade them ſelues that they are very expert and cunning herein. But I and ſuch as I am haue ſcarſely learned the firſt principles therof. It is learned in deede, but ſo long as the fleſh and ſinne doe endure, it can neuer be perfectly learned,<note place="margin">A godly man is partly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lavve, and partly vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der grace.</note> and as it ſhould be. So then a Chriſtian is diuided into two times. In that he is fleſh, he is vnder the lawe: In that he is ſpirite he is vnder grace. Concupiſcence, couetouſnes, ambition and pride doe alwayes cleaue to the fleſh: alſo ignoraunce, contempt of God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie, murmuring and grudging againſt God, becauſe he hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and breaketh of our counſelles, our deuiſes and enterpriſes, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:9456:169"/>
becauſe he ſpeedely puniſheth not ſuch as are wicked, rebellious, and contemptuous perſons. &amp;c. Such kinde of ſinnes are rooted in the fleſh of the Faithfull. Wherefore if thou behold nothing but the fleſh, thou ſhalt abide alwayes vnder the time of the lawe. But theſe dayes muſt be ſhortened, or elſe no fleſh ſhould be ſaued. The lawe muſt haue his time appoynted wherein it muſt haue his ende. The time of the lawe therefore is not perpetuall, but hath his ende,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.6.

                     </note> which ende is Ieſus Chriſt. But the time of grace is eternall. For <hi>Chriſt being once dead, dieth no more.</hi> He is eternall: therefore the time of grace is alſo eternall.</p>
                  <p>We may not lightly paſſe ouer ſuch notable ſentences as theſe which are in <hi>Paule,</hi> as the Papiſtes and Sectaries are wont to doe. For they containe woordes of life, which doe wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort and confirme afflicted conſciences: And they which know and vnderſtand them well, can iudge of Faith: they can diſcerne a true feare from a falſe feare:<note place="margin">Feare may no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hovve feare muſt be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished.</note> they can iudge of all inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart, and diſcerne all ſpirites. The feare of God is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and a precious thing, but it muſt not alwayes continue. In deede it ought to be alwayes in a Chriſtian, becauſe ſinne is alwayes in him: but it muſt not be alone: for then is it the feare of <hi>Caine, Saule</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> that is to ſay, a ſeruile and a deſperate feare. A Chriſtian therefore muſt vanquiſh feare by Faith in the word of grace: he muſt turne away his eyes from the time of the lawe, and looke vnto Chriſte and vnto Faith which is to be reuealed. Here begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth feare to be ſweete vnto vs, and maketh vs to delite in God. For if a man doe onely beholde the lawe and ſinne, ſetting Faith aſide, he ſhall neuer be able to put away feare, but ſhall at length fall to deſperation.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth <hi>Paule</hi> very well diſtinguiſh the time of the lawe and grace. Let vs alſo learne rightly to diſtinguiſh the time of them both, not in wordes, but in the inward affections: which is a very hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For albeit theſe two things are ſeparate farre aſunder,<note place="margin">Feare &amp; Faith are ſeparated farre aſunder, and yet are ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one heart.</note> yet are they moſt nerely ioyned together in one heart.

For they are ſo vnited together, that the one is ſwalowed vppe of the other. Wherfore there is no coniunction like vnto this.</p>
                  <p>At this place: <hi>Wherefore then ſerueth the lavve? Paule</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to diſpute of the lawe: alſo of the vſe and the abuſe thereof, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  <p>That which I haue before ſo often repeted concerning both the vſes of the lawe, namely, the Ciuill and the Spirituall vſe, doe ſufficiently declare that the lawe is not geuen for the righteous: but (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſayeth in an other place) for the vnrighteous and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious.

This vſe of the lawe hath no ende: and of this <hi>Paule</hi> here ſpeaketh nothing. But they that are to be iuſtified, are exerciſed with this Spirituall vſe of the lawe for a time: for it doth not alwayes continue, as the Ciuill vſe of the lawe doth: but it looketh to Faith which is to be reuealed, and when Chriſte commeth it ſhall haue his ende. Hereby we may plainly ſee that all the ſentences wherin <hi>Paule</hi> entreateth of the ſpirituall vſe of the lawe,<note place="margin">Hovve ſuch ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces muſt be vnderſtand vvherin Paule handleth the ſpirituall vſe of the lavve.</note> muſt be vnderſtand of thoſe which are to be iuſtified, and not of thoſe which are iuſtified already. For they which are iuſtified already, in as much as they abide in Chriſte, are farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all lawe. The lawe then muſt be layed vppon thoſe that are to be iuſtified, that they may be ſhutte vppe in the priſon thereof, vntill the righteouſnes of Faith come: Not that they obtaine this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes through the lawe (for that were not to vſe the lawe rightly,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:9456:170"/>
but to abuſe it): but that when they are caſt downe and humbled by the lawe, they ſhould flie vnto Chriſte,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> 
                     <hi>vvho is the end of the lavve to righteouſnes, to euery one that beleueth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, firſt they which abuſe the law,<note place="margin">VVho are abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the lavve.</note> are all the Iuſticiaries and hypocrites which dreame that men are iuſtified by the lawe. For that vſe of the lawe doth not exerciſe and driue a man to Faith which is to be reuealed, but it maketh full, careles, and arrogant hypocrites, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and preſuming of the righteouſnes of the lawe, and hindreth the righteouſnes of Faith. Secondly, they abuſe the lawe which will vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly exempt a Chriſtian man from the law, as the brainſicke Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes went about to doe: which was the occaſion that they raiſed vppe that ſedition of the ruſticall people.<note n="*" place="margin">He ſpeaketh of the peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Libertines that vvould haue no feare of God nor lavve, to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them from their ſinnes. <hi>1. Pet. 2.16.</hi>
                     </note> Of this ſort there are very many alſo at this day which profeſſe the Goſpell with vs: who being deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the tyrannie of the Pope by the doctrine of the Goſpell, doe dreame that the Chriſtian libertie is a diſſolute and a carnall libertie to doe what ſo euer they liſt. Theſe (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayeth) haue the libertie of the ſpirite as a cloke of maliciouſnes, through which the name of God and the Goſpell of Chriſte is ſclaundered euery where, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall once ſuffer worthy puniſhment for this their vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Thirdly, ſuch doe alſo abuſe the lawe, who feeling the terrours thereof, doe not vnderſtand that ſuch terrours ought no longer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, but vnto Chriſte. This abuſe in them is the cauſe that they fall to deſperation: as in the hypocrites it is the cauſe of arrogancie and preſumption.</p>
                  <p>Contrariwiſe,<note place="margin">The true vſe of the lavve can not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemed as it is vvorthy.</note> the true vſe of the lawe can neuer be eſtemed and magnified as it is worthy: namely, that when the conſcience ſhutte vp vnder the lawe, deſpaireth not, but being inſtructed by the wiſedom of the holy Ghoſt concludeth with it ſelfe after this ſort: I am in deede ſhut vppe as a priſoner vnder the lawe, but not for euer: yea this ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vppe ſhall turne to my great profite. How ſo? Becauſe that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus ſhut vppe, ſhall be driuen to ſigh and ſeeke the hand of an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. &amp;c. After this maner the lawe is as an enforcer, which by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion bringeth the hungrie vnto Chriſte,<note place="margin">The true of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the lavve.</note> that he may ſatiſfie them with his good things. Wherefore the true office of the lawe is to ſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs our ſinnes, to make vs giltie, to humble vs, to kill vs, and to bring vs downe to hell, and finally to take from vs all helpe, all ſuccour, all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort: but yet altogether to this end, that we may be iuſtified, exalted, quickned to life, caried vppe into heauen, and obtaine all good things. Therfore it doth not onely kill, but it killeth that we may liue.</p>

We may eaſily coniecture what affection the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes bare to their <hi>Moiſes,</hi> and how zelouſly they performed that which he commaunded. In deede ſuch was their loue and obedience towards him,<note place="margin">Exod. 17.4.</note> that euery hower (as the Storie teſtifieth) they would with all their hearts haue ſtoned him to death. It is not poſſible therefore that the ſcholer ſhould loue his maſter.<note place="margin">The ſcholer can not loue his maſter.</note> For howe can he loue him which keepeth him in priſon, that is to ſay, which ſuffereth him not to doe that which gladly he would? And if he doe any thing againſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, by and by he is rebuked and chaſtiſed, yea and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained moreouer to kiſſe the rodde when he is beaten. Is not this (I pray you) a goodly righteouſnes and obedience of the ſcholer, that he obeyeth his maſter ſo ſeuerely threatning and ſo ſharply correcting him, and kiſſeth the rodde? But doth he this with a good wil? As ſoone as his maſter hath turned his backe, he breaketh the rodde or caſteth it into the fire. And if he had any power ouer his maſter, he would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him ſelfe to be beaten of his maſter: but rather he would beat him. And yet notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding the ſcholemaſter is very neceſſary for the child to enſtruct and to chaſtiſe him: otherwiſe the childe without this diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, enſtruction, and good education ſhould be vtterly loſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſcholemaſter therfore is appoynted for the child to teach him, to bring him vp,<note place="margin">VVhie a Scholemaſter is apoynted for a childe.</note> &amp; to kepe him as it were in priſon. But to what ende, or how long? Is it to the ende, that this ſtreit and ſharpe dealing of the ſcholemaſter ſhould alwayes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue? or that the child ſhould remaine in continuall bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage? Not ſo, but onely for a time, that this obedience, this priſon and correction might turne to the profit of the child, that in time he might be heire and Prince. For it is not the fathers will, that his ſonne ſhould be alwayes ſubiect to the ſcholemaſter, and alwayes beaten with roddes: but that by this inſtruction and diſcipline he may be made able and meete to be his fathers ſucceſſour.</p>

                  <p>By this goodly ſimilitude <hi>Paule</hi> ſheweth what is the true vſe of the lawe, namely, that it iuſtifieth not hypocrites, for they remaine w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out Chriſt in their preſumption &amp; ſecuritie: And contrariwiſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it leaueth not in death &amp; damnation thoſe that are of a contrite heart (ſo that they vſe it as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth): but driueth them vnto Chriſt.

The lawe then is good, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and iuſt, ſo that a man vſe it as he ſhould doe.

For as Chriſte came once corporally at the time appoynted, aboliſhed the whole lawe, vanquiſhed ſinne, deſtroyed death and hell:<note place="margin">The ſpirituall comming of Chriſte.</note> euen ſo he commeth ſpiritually without ceaſing, and daily quencheth and killeth theſe ſinnes in vs.</p>
                  <p>This I ſay that thou mayeſt be able to aunſwere, if any ſhall thus obiecte: Chriſte came into the world, and atonce toke away all our ſinnes, and clenſed vs by his bloud: what neede we then to heare the Goſpell, or to receaue the Sacramentes? True it is that in as much as thou beholdeſt Chriſte,<note place="margin">Hovve farre forth the lavv is abolished.</note> the lawe and ſinne are quite aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But Chriſte is not yet come vnto thee: or if he be come, yet notwithſtanding there are remnauntes of ſinne in thee: thou art not yet throughly leuened. For where concupiſcence, heauines of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and feare of death is, there is yet alſo the lawe and ſinne. Chriſt is not yet throughly come: but when he cometh in deede, he driueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way feare and heauines, and bringeth peace and quietnes of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. So farre forth then as I do apprehend Chriſt by Faith, ſo much is the lawe aboliſhed vnto me. But my fleſh, the world, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill doe hinder Faith in me, that it can not be perfect. Right gladly I would that that litle light of Faith which is in my heart, were ſpread thoroughout all my body and all the members thereof: but it is not done: it is not by and by ſpreade, but onely beginneth to be ſpreade. In the meane ſeaſon this is our conſolation,<note place="margin">The conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the godly.</note> that we hauing the firſt fruites of the ſpirite, doe nowe beginne to be leue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: But we ſhall be thoroughly leuened when this body of ſinne is diſſolued, and we ſhall riſe newe creatures wholy together with Chriſte.</p>
                  <p>Albeit then that Chriſte be one and the ſame yeſterday, to day,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.8.</note> and ſhall be for euer, and albeit that all the faithfull which were before Chriſt had the Goſpell and Faith: yet notwithſtanding Chriſte came once in the time before determined.

put on, that is to ſay, folowe theſe vertues.</p>
                  <p>But the putting on of Chriſt according to the Goſpell, conſiſteth not in imitation, but in a newe birth and a new creation: that is to ſay,<note place="margin">To put on Chriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Goſpell.</note> in putting on Chriſtes innocencie, his righteouſnes, his wiſedom, his power, his ſauing health, his life and his ſpirite.

Now, when we are apparelled with Chriſt, as with the robe of righteouſnes and our ſaluation, then we muſt put on Chriſte alſo as the apparell of imitation and example.

To ſay this, it is an eaſie matter: but in time of tentation when the conſcience wreſtleth in the preſence of God, to doe it in deede, of all things it is the hardeſt: to witte, that when the lawe accuſeth thee, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth thee, reuealeth vnto thee thy ſinne, threatneth to thee the wrath of God &amp; eternall death, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then (I ſay) thou ſhouldeſt haue ſuch ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of faith in Chriſt as if there had neuer ben any law or any ſinne, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt, mere grace, and redemption: or that thou ſhouldeſt then be able to ſay: O law, I will not heare thee, for thou haſt a ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mering &amp; a ſlow tounge: moreouer, the fulnes of time is now come,<note place="margin">He alluded to the ſlovv tounge and ſtammering ſpeech of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>Rom. 4.18.</hi>

Here therefore, if thou be wiſe, baniſh this ſtutting and ſtamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Moiſes</hi> farre from thee, with his lawe, and in any wiſe let not his terrours and threatnings moue thee.

                  <p>So Chriſte a diuine and humane perſon, begotten of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning,<note place="margin">Chriſte came not to make lavves, but to take the lavve cleane avvay.</note> and borne of the virgin in the time apoynted, came not to make a law, but to feele and ſuffer the terrours of the lawe with all extremitie, and to ouercome the ſame, that ſo he might vtterly aboliſh the lawe. He was not made a teacher of the lawe, but an obedient diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the law, that by this his obedience he might redeme them which were vnder the lawe.

                     <note place="margin">It is not the proper office of Chriſte to teach the lavv</note>Now, wheras Chriſt in the Goſpell geueth commaundements, and teacheth the law, or rather expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it, this pertaineth not to the doctrine of Iuſtification, but of good workes. Moreouer, it is not the proper office of Chriſte (for the which he came principally into the world) to teach the law, but an accidentall or a by office: like as it was to heale the weake, to raiſe vppe the dead. &amp;c. Theſe are in deede excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and diuine workes: but yet not the very proper and principall workes of Chriſte. For the Prophets alſo taught the law, &amp; wrought miracles. But Chriſt is God and man, who fighting againſt the lawe, ſuffered the vttermoſt cruelty and tyranny therof. And in that he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the tyranny of the law, he vanquiſhed it in himſelfe: And afterward being raiſed vppe againe from death, he condemned and vtterly aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the law which was our deadly enemie, ſo that it can not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne

and kill the faithfull any more. Wherfore the true and proper office of Chriſt is to wraſtle with the lawe, with the ſinne and the death of the whole world, &amp; ſo to wraſtle that he muſt ſuffer &amp; abide al theſe things, and by ſuffering them in him ſelfe, conquere and aboliſh them, and by this meanes deliuer the Faithfull from the lawe and from all euils. Therefore to teach the lawe and to worke myracles,<note place="margin">The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler benefites of Chriſte.</note> are particuler be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites of Chriſt, for the which he came not principally into the world.

                  <p>Seing then that Chriſt hath ouercome the law in his owne perſon, it foloweth neceſſarily that he is naturally God.<note place="margin">Chriſt is God by nature.</note> For there is none elſe whether he be man or angell, which is aboue the law, but onely God.

But who ſo euer doe feele any loue or deſire to the word, let them acknowledge with tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfulnes, that this affection is powred into them by the holy Ghoſt. For we are not borne with this affection and deſire, neither can we be taught by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lawes how we may obtaine it: but this chaunge is plainly and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the worke of the right hand of the moſt higheſt. Therfore when we willingly and gladly heare the word preached concerning Chriſte the ſonne of God, who for vs was made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and became ſubiect to the law, to deliuer vs from the malediction of the law, hell, death &amp; damnation: then let vs aſſure our ſelues that God by and with this preaching ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the holy Ghoſt into our hearts. Wherfore it is very expedient for the Godly to know, that they haue the holy Ghoſt.</p>

                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:9456:185"/>This I ſay, to confute that pernicious doctrine of the Papiſts,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that no man could knovv vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he vvere in the fauour of God or no.</note> which taught that no man can certainly know (although his life be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo vpright &amp; blameles) whether he be in the fauour of God or no. And this ſentence commonly receaued, was a ſpeciall principle and article of Faith in the whole Papacie, wherby they vtterly defaced the doctrine of Faith, tormented mens conſciences, baniſhed Chriſt quite out of the Church, darkened and denied all the benefites of the holy Ghoſt, aboliſhed the whole worſhip of God, ſet vp Idolatrie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of God, and blaſphemie againſt God in mens heartes. For he that doubteth of Gods good will towards him, and doth not aſſure him ſelfe that he is in the fauour of God, this man can not beleue that he hath forgeuenes of his ſinnes, that God careth for him, or that he ſhall be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth very well and godly, that euery man ſeeth moſt certainely his owne Faith, if he haue Faith. This doe they deny. God forbid (ſay they) that I ſhould aſſure my ſelfe that I am vnder grace, that I am holy, and that I haue the holy Ghoſt, yea although I liue godly and doe all good workes. Ye which are yong, and are not infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this pernicious opinion (whervpon the whole kingdom of the Pope is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded) take heede &amp; flie from it as from a moſt daungerous plague. We that are old men haue ben trained vp in this errour euen from our youth, and haue ben ſo nuſled therein, that it hath taken deepe roote in our hearts.<note place="margin">VVe muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our ſelues that vve are vnder grace. <hi>Rom. 8.9.</hi>
                     </note> Therefore it is to vs no leſſe labour to vnlearne and forget the ſame, then to learne and lay hold vpon true Faith. But we muſt be aſſured &amp; out of dout that we are vnder grace, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we pleaſe God for Chriſtes ſake, and that we haue the holy Ghoſt: <hi>For if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue not the ſpirite of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherfore, whether thou be a Miniſter of Gods word or a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in the common wealth, thou muſt aſſuredly thinke that thy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice pleaſeth God: but this canſt thou neuer doe vnleſſe thou haue the holy Ghoſt. But thou wilt ſay, I doubt not but that my office plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God becauſe it is Gods ordinaunce, but I doubt of mine owne perſon whether it pleaſe God or no. Here thou muſt reſort to the word of God, which teacheth and aſſureth vs, that, not onely the office of the perſon, but alſo the perſon it ſelf pleaſeth God. For the perſon is baptiſed, beleueth in Chriſt, is purged in his bloud from all his ſinnes, liueth in the communion and felowſhip of his Church: Moreouer he doth not onely loue the pure doctrine of the word, but alſo he is glad and greatly reioyceth when he ſeeth it aduaunced, and the nomber of

                     <hi>but thy lavve doe I loue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ought therefore to be ſurely perſwaded, that not onely our office, but alſo our perſon pleaſeth God: Yea whatſoeuer it ſayth, doth, or thinketh particularly, the ſame pleaſeth God, not for our owne ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, but for Chriſtes ſake, who was made vnder the law for vs. Now, we are ſure that Chriſte pleaſeth God, that he is holy. &amp;c. For as much then as Chriſte pleaſeth God and we are in him, we alſo pleaſe God and are holy.<note place="margin">Grace is more ſtrong and mighty then ſinne.</note> And although ſinne doe ſtill remaine in our fleſh, and we alſo daily fall and offend, yet grace is more aboundant and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then ſinne. The mercy and truth of the Lord raigneth ouer vs for euer. Wherfore ſinne ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not terrifie vs and make vs doutfull of the grace of God which is in vs. For Chriſte that moſt mighty Giaunt hath quite aboliſhed the law, condemned ſinne, va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed death and all euils.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.34.</note> So long as he is at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right hand of God, making interceſſion for vs, we can not doubt of the grace and fauour of God towardes vs.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, God hath alſo ſent the ſpirite of his ſonne into our hearts, as <hi>Paule</hi> here ſayth. But Chriſte is moſt certaine in his ſpirite that he pleaſeth God. &amp;c: therefore we alſo hauing the ſame ſpirite of Chriſte, muſt be aſſured that we are vnder grace for his ſake that is moſt aſſured. This I haue ſayd concerning the inward teſtimonie, wherby a Chriſtian mans heart ought to be fully perſwaded that he is vnder grace &amp; hath the holy Ghoſt. Now, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward ſignes (as before I haue ſaid) are, gladly to heare of Chriſt, to preach &amp; teach Chriſt, to render thanks vnto him, to praiſe him, to confeſſe him, yea w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the loſſe of goodes and life: Moreouer, to doe our duetie according to our voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we are able: to do it (I ſay) in faith, ioy. &amp;c: Not to delite in ſinne, nor to thruſt our ſelues into an other mans vocation, but to attend vpon our owne, to helpe our needy brother, to comfort the heauy harted. &amp;c. By theſe ſignes, as by certein effects &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, we are fully aſſured &amp; confirmed, that we are in Gods fauour. The wicked alſo do imagine that they haue the ſame ſignes, but they haue nothing leſſe. Hereby we may plainly ſee that the Pope with his doctrine doth nothing elſe, but trouble and torment mens conſciences, &amp; at length driueth them to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration: For he not onely teacheth, but alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth men to dout. Therfore,<note place="margin">Pſal. 5.9.

                  </p>
                  <p>Here we may ſee what great infirmitie is yet in the Faith of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:9456:186"/>
Godly. For if we could be fully perſwaded that we are vnder grace,<note place="margin">VVeaknes of Faith in the godly.</note> that our ſinnes are forgeuen, that we haue the ſpirit of Chriſt, that we are the children of God: then doubtles we ſhould be ioyfull, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God for this ineſtimable gift. But becauſe we feele co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that is to ſay, feare, doutfulnes, anguiſh and heuines of heart, &amp; ſuch like, therfore we can not aſſure our ſelues hereof: yea our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence iudgeth it a great preſumption and pride to chalenge this glory. Wherfore, if we will vnderſtand this thing rightly and as we ſhould doe, we muſt put it in practiſe: for without experience and practiſe it can neuer be learned.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore let euery man ſo practiſe with him ſelfe, that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be fully aſſured that he is vnder grace, and that his perſon and his workes doe pleaſe God. And if he feele in himſelfe any wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering or douting, let him exerciſe his Faith and wraſtle againſt this douting, and let him endeuour to attaine more certaintie, ſo that he may be able to ſay: I know that I am accepted,<note place="margin">The full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Faith. <hi>Galath. 4.4.</hi>
                     </note> and that I haue the holy Ghoſt: not for mine owne worthines, my worke, my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, but for Chriſtes ſake, who of his ineſtimable loue towardes vs, made him ſelf thrall and ſubiect to the lawe, &amp; tooke away the ſinnes of the world.

Moreouer, I gladly heare, read, ſing &amp; wryte of him, and I deſire nothing more then that his Goſpel may be knowne to the whole world, and that many may be conuerted vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things doe plainly witneſſe that the holy Ghoſt is preſent with vs &amp; in vs. For ſuch things are not wrought in the heart by mans ſtrength, nor gotten by his induſtrie, exerciſe or trauell, but are obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Chriſt alone, who firſt maketh vs righteous by the knowledge of him in his holy Goſpel, and afterwardes he createth a new heart in vs, bringeth forth new motions, &amp; geueth vnto vs that aſſurance wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are perſwaded that we pleaſe the father for his ſake:<note place="margin">Eſay. 53.11.

                     <hi>Paule</hi> therfore ſignifieth by theſe words, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is yet infirmitie in the godly: As he doth alſo in the .8. chap. to the Rom. when he ſayeth: <hi>The ſpirite helpeth our infirmities.</hi> For as much therfore as the ſenſe and feeling of the contrary is ſtrong in vs: that is to ſay, for as much as we feele more the diſpleaſure of God, then his good will and fauour towardes vs: therefore the holy Ghoſt is ſent into our heartes, which doth not only ſigh and make requeſt for vs, but mightely crieth: <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and praieth for vs according to the wil of God w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> teares and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable gronings.

                  <p>The Papiſtes dreamed that holy men had the holy Ghoſt in ſuch ſort that they neuer had nor felt any tentation.

Had it not bene better for vs to haue ſerued the Egyptians, then here wretchedly to die in the wildernes? The holy Ghoſt was not here in <hi>Moiſes</hi> by bare ſpeculation and knowledge onely, but truely and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, who made interceſſion for him with an vnſpeakeable groning, ſo that he ſighed vnto the Lord and ſayd: O Lord at thy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment haue I led forth this people: helpe vs therfore.

                  <p>This matter I haue the more largely proſecuted, that I might plainly ſhew what the office of the holy Ghoſt is, and when he ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſeth the ſame.

If we then folow our owne ſenſe &amp; beleue thoſe cryings, we ſhall thinke our ſelues to be deſtitute of all helpe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of the holy Ghoſt, and to be vtterly caſt away from the preſence of God. Nay rather let vs then remember what <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth: <hi>The ſpirite helpeth our infirmities, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo it crieth: <hi>Abba Father,</hi> that is to ſay, it vttereth a certaine feeble ſighing and groning of the heart (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto vs) which notwithſtanding before God is a loud crie and an vnſpeakeable groning.<note place="margin">The gronings of the faithful before God, are great cries.</note> Wherfore in the middes of thy temptation and infirmitie, cleaue onely vnto Chriſte &amp; grone vnto him: he geueth the holy Ghoſt which crieth <hi>Abba Father:</hi> And this feeble groning is a mighty crie in the eares of God, and ſo filleth heauen and earth, that God heareth nothing elſe: and moreouer, it drowneth the cries of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things whatſoeuer.</p>

with any wordes or eloquence, for no tongue can expreſſe them.</p>
                  <p>I haue vſed many wordes to declare that a Chriſtian muſt aſſure him ſelfe that he is in the fauour of God, and that he hath the crying of the holy Ghoſt in his heart.<note place="margin">The Pope tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght that vve muſt dout of Gods fauour tovvardes vs</note> This haue I done that we may learne to reiect and vtterly to abandon that deuilliſh opinion of the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Pope, which taught that a man ought to be vncertaine and to ſtand in dout of the grace and fauour of God towards him. If this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion be receaued, then Chriſt profiteth nothing. For he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> douteth of Gods fauour towardes him, muſt needes dout alſo of the promiſes of God, and ſo conſequently of the will of God,<note place="margin">He ſpeaketh not here of that douting vvhich ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times riſeth of infirmitie in the godly: but of vvilful dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting vvhich the Papiſtes teach &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> and of the benefites of Chriſte: namely that he was borne, ſuffered, died, and roſe againe for vs. &amp;c. But there can be no greater blaſphemie againſt God, then to deny his promiſes, to deny God himſelfe, Chriſt. &amp;c. Wherfore it was not onely an extreme madnes, but an horrible impietie that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Monks did ſo earneſtly entice the youth both men and women to their Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, to their religious and holy orders (as they called them) as to a moſt certaine ſtate of ſaluation, and yet, when they had thus done, they bad them doubt of the grace and fauour of God towards them.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, the Pope called all the world to the obedience of the holy Church of Rome, as to an holy ſtate, in the which they might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doutedly attaine ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet after he had brought them vnder the obedience of his lawes, he commaunded them to dout of their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So the kingdom of Antichriſt braggeth and vaunteth at the firſt,<note place="margin">The Pope kingdom.</note> of the holines of his orders, his rules and his lawes, and aſſuredly promiſeth euerlaſting life to ſuch as obſerue and kepe them. But afterwards when theſe miſerable men haue long afflicted their bodies with watching, faſting, and ſuch like exerciſes according to the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ordinaunces of men, this is all that they gaine thereby, that they are vncertaine whether this obedience pleaſe God or no?<note place="margin">The Papacy is a very ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terhouſe of conſciences.</note> Thus Satan moſt horribly dallied in the death of ſoules through the Pope, and therefore is the Papacie a ſlaughterhouſe of conſciences, and the very kingdom of the Deuill.</p>
                  <p>Nowe, to eſtabliſh and confirme this pernicious &amp; curſed errour, they alleaged the ſaying of Salomon, Eccle. 9.<note place="margin">Eccle. 9.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Here we can not dout, but that God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with vs, that he loueth vs in dede, that the hatred and wrath of God is taken away, ſeeing he ſuffered his ſonne to die for vs wretched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Although this matter be ſette out and often repeted thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Goſpell, yet it profited nothing at all.

                  <p>It is expedient for vs to know theſe things: Firſt becauſe the Papiſtes vaunt of their holines, as if they had neuer committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny euill. Therefore they muſt be conuinced by their owne abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherewith they haue filled the whole world, as their owne Bookes doe witnes, wherof there is yet an infinite nomber: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we may be fully certified that we haue the pure doctrine of the Goſpell:<note place="margin">Doutfulnes of ſaluation in th Papacie.</note> of which certaintie the Pope can not glory. In whoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom though all things elſe were ſound and vncorrupt, yet this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous doctrine of douting of Gods grace and fauour, paſſeth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther monſters. And although it be manifeſt that the enemies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes Goſpell teach vncertaine things becauſe they commaund that mens conſciences ſhould remaine in dout, yet notwithſtanding they condemne and kill vs as heretikes, becauſe we diſſent from them, and teach thoſe things which are certaine. And this they doe with ſuch deuilliſh rage and crueltie, as if they were moſt aſſured of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore geue thankes vnto God, that we are deliuered from this monſtrous doctrine of douting, and can now aſſure our ſelues that the holy Ghoſt crieth and bringeth forth in our heartes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable gronings.<note place="margin">Hovv vve mai knovv that are i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gods fauour, and haue the holy Ghoſt.</note> And this is our ankerhold and our foundation.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:9456:190"/>
Contrariwiſe, the Pope commaundeth vs to looke, not vnto God the promiſer, nor vnto Chriſt our high Biſhop, but vnto our works &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. On the one ſide muſt nedes folow douting &amp; deſperation: but on y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other ſide aſſurance of Gods fauour and ioy of the ſpirit. For we cleaue vnto God who can not lie.

In this caſe I can not dout,<note place="margin">The doctrine vvhich vve profeſſe, is cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine.</note> vnleſſe I will vtterly deny God. And this is the reaſon that our doctrine is moſt ſure and certaine, becauſe it carieth vs out of our ſelues, and from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our ſelues, to the end that we ſhould not leane to our owne ſtrength, to our owne conſcience, to our owne feeling, our owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and our owne workes: but to that which is without vs, that is to ſay, the promiſe and truth of God which can not deceaue vs. This the Pope knoweth not, and therefore he wickedly imagineth that no man knoweth, be he neuer ſo iuſt or ſo wiſe, whether he be worthy of loue or of hatred. But if he be iuſt and wiſe he knoweth aſſuredly that he is beloued of God, or elſe he is neither iuſt nor wiſe.</p>

For ſuch is the peruerſnes and ingratitude of the world, that the better a man deſerueth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> leſſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks he ſhall haue, and oftentimes he that ſhould be his moſt friend,<note place="margin">VVhat thanks the vvorld ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth to them that deſerue vvell of it.</note> ſhall be his moſt enemie. Contrariwiſe, ſuch as leaſt deſerue, ſhall be moſt eſtemed. So <hi>Dauid</hi> a holy man and a good King, was caſt out of his kingdom. The Prophetes, Chriſte and his Apoſtles were ſlaine. To conclude, the hyſtories of all nations witnes, that many men well deſeruing of their countrey, were caſt into baniſhment by their owne Citizens, and there liued in great miſery, and ſome alſo ſhamefully periſhed in priſon. Wherefore <hi>Salomon</hi> in this place ſpeaketh not of the conſcience hauing to doe with God, and of the fauour and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, but of the iudgementes and affections of men among them ſelues. As though he would ſay: There are many iuſt and wiſe men, by whom God worketh much good, and geueth peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnto men. But ſo farre of are they from acknowledging the ſame, that oftentimes they requite them againe very ilfauouredly for their well deſeruings. Therefore although a man doe all things neuer ſo well, yet he knoweth not whether by this his diligence and faithfulnes he deſerue the hatred or fauour of men.</p>
                  <p>So we at this day, when we thought we ſhould haue found fauour
<pb facs="tcp:9456:191"/>
among our countreymen the Germains, for that we preach vnto them the Goſpell of peace, life, and eternall ſaluation, in ſtede of fauour we haue found bitter and cruell hatred. In deede at the firſt many were greatly delited with our doctrine, and receaued it gladly. We ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they would haue ben our friends and brethren, and that with one conſent together with vs, they would haue planted and ſet forth this doctrine to others. But now we finde that they are falſe brethern and our deadly enemies, which ſow and ſpread abrode errours &amp; falſe doctrine, and that which we teach well and godly, they peruert and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow, ſtirring vp offences in the Churches. Whoſoeuer therefore doth his duety godly and faithfully, in what kinde of life ſo euer he be, and for his well doing receaueth nothing againe but the vnkindnes and hatred of men,<note place="margin">Hovv vve muſt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes. <hi>Pſal. 109.3.4.</hi>
                     </note> let him not vexe and torment him ſelfe therfore: but let him ſay with Chriſte: <hi>They hated me vvithout a cauſe.</hi> Alſo: <hi>For that they should haue loued me, they ſclaundered me, but I did pray.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pope therefore with this deuilliſh doctrine, whereby he commaunded men to dout of the fauour of God towards them, tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way God and all his promiſes out of the Church, buried all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of Chriſt, &amp; aboliſhed the whole Goſpel. Theſe inconueniences do neceſſarily folow: for men doe not leane to the promiſes of God, but to their owne workes and merites. Therefore they can not be aſſured of the good will of God towardes them, but muſt needes dout therof, and ſo at length deſpaire. No man can vnderſtand what Gods will is, and what pleaſeth him,<note place="margin">The vvill of God is ſeene in his vvord.</note> but in his word. This word aſſureth vs that God caſt away all anger and diſpleaſure which he had conceaued againſt vs, when he gaue his onely begotten ſonne for our ſinnes. &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs vtterly abandon this deuilliſh douting wherwith the whole Papacie was poyſoned, and let vs be fully aſſured that God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto vs, that we pleaſe him, that he hath a care ouer vs, that we haue the holy Ghoſt which maketh interceſſion for vs with ſuch cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and groning as can not be expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Now, this is the true crying and groning in deede, when a man in tentation calleth vpon God: not as a tyranne, not as an angry iudge, not as a torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter, but as a father, although this groning be ſo ſoft &amp; ſo ſecrete, that it can ſcantly be perceaued. For in ſerious tentations, and in the time of trial where the conſcience wraſtleth with the iudgement of God, it is wont to call God, not a Father, but an vniuſt, an angry and cruell tyranne and iudge. And this crying which Satan ſtirreth vp in the heart, farre paſſeth the cry of the ſpirite, and is ſtrongly felt.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:9456:191"/>
For then it ſeemeth that God hath forſaken vs, and will caſt vs downe into hell.

Here now it is time that thou turne away thine eyes from the law, from works, and from the ſenſe and feling of thine owne conſcience, and lay hold by Faith of the promiſe, that is to ſay, of the word of grace &amp; life, which raiſeth vppe againe the conſcience, ſo that now it beginneth to grone and ſay: Although the law accuſe me, ſinne and death terrifie me neuer ſo much, yet O my God, thou promiſeſt grace, righteouſnes and euerlaſting life through Ieſus Chriſt: And ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> promiſe bringeth a ſighing &amp; a groning, which crieth <hi>Abba Father.</hi>

As if he would ſay: Ye haue teachers which will bring you backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the bondage of the law. This did not I: but by my doctrine I called you out of darknes &amp; of the ignorance of God, into a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful light and knowledge of him.<note place="margin">1.

Now, ſeeing this is true, why doe ye ſo ſoone forſake the light and returne to darknes? Why doe ye ſuffer your ſelues ſo eaſily to be brought from grace vnto the law, from freedom to bondage?</p>
                  <p>Here againe we ſee (as before I haue ſayd) that to fall in Faith is an eaſie matter,<note place="margin">To ſlide in Faith, is an eaſie thing.</note> as the example of the Galathians witneſſeth.

When he hath brought this about, then is Chriſte taken away. It is not without cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh ſo much and ſo often of Chriſte, and that he goeth about ſo purely to ſet forth the doctrine of Faith: wherevnto he attributeth righteouſnes onely and alone, &amp; taketh it from the law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that the lawe hath a cleane contrary effect: that is, to engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrath, to encreaſe ſinne &amp;c.

ſhould alwayes embrace him and cleaue faſt vnto him, who being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there is no daunger: yea there is the Faithfull groning, fatherly good will, adoption and inheritaunce.</p>
                  <p>But why ſayeth <hi>Paule</hi> that the Galathians turned backe againe to weake and beggerly rudiments or ceremonies, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">VVhy Paule ſayth that the Galathians returned back to vveake and beggerly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> to the law, wheras they neuer had the law: for they were Gentiles (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he wrote theſe things to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes alſo, as afterwardes we wil declare): or why ſpeaketh he not rather after this maner? <hi>Once vvhen ye knevve not God, ye did ſeruice vnto them vvhich by nature vvere no gods:</hi> but now, ſeing ye know God, why turne ye back again, forſaking the true God, to worſhip Idols?

                  <p>The reaſon is,<note place="margin">God is knovven by Chriſte onely. <hi>Iohn. 1.18.</hi>
                     </note> becauſe God will or can be knowen no otherwiſe then by Chriſt, according to that ſaying of Iohn. <hi>1: The onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne vvhich is in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> He is the Seede promiſed vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whom God hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed all his promiſes.

For in Chriſt we ſee that God is not a cruell exactour or a iudge, but a moſt fauourable, louing and merciful Father, who to the ende he might bleſſe vs, that is to ſay, deliuer vs from the lawe, ſinne, death and all euils, and might endue vs with grace, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and euerlaſting life, ſpared not his owne Sonne,<note place="margin">

                  <p>He that is falne from this knowledge, muſt nedes conceiue this fantaſie in his heart: I will ſet vp ſuch a ſeruice of God: I will enter into ſuch an order: I will chooſe this or that worke, and ſo will I ſerue God, and I doute not but God will accepte this, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me wyth euerlaſting life for the ſame.

and liberal, geuing all good things euen to the vnworthy and vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: much more will he geue vnto me grace and euerlaſting life for my great and manifold good deedes and merites. This is the higheſt wiſedom,<note place="margin">The higheſt vviſedom of reaſon.</note> righteouſnes and religion that reaſon can iudge of: which is common to all nations, to the Papiſts, Iewes, Turkes, heretikes &amp;c.

For God hath not promiſed that he will ſaue and iuſtifie men for the religions, obſeruations, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and ordinaunces deuiſed by men: yea God abhorreth nothing more (as the whole Scripture witneſſeth) then ſuch willworks, ſuch

Therefore the Anabaptiſt i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining with him ſelfe that he pleaſeth God if he be rebaptiſed, if he forſake his houſe, wife and children, if he mortifie his fleſh and ſuffer much aduerſity, and at length death it ſelfe, yet there is not one droppe of the knowledge of Chriſte in him, but ſecluding Chriſt, he dreameth altogether of his owne workes, of the forſaking of his goodes, of his affliction and mortification, and now differeth nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Turke, Iewe, or Papiſt in ſpirite or in heart, but onely in the outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, workes and ceremonies which he hath choſen to him ſelfe.

                  <p>There are at this day very many like vnto theſe, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding would be counted among the true profeſſors and teachers of the Goſpell, and as touching the words, they teach that men are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from their ſinnes by the death of Chriſt.

                  <p>And who ſo liſteth to amplifie this matter, may further ſay, that the lawe is a weake and a beggerly rudiment, becauſe it maketh men more weake and beggerly: Againe, becauſe that of it ſelfe it hath no power or riches whereby it is able to geue or to bring righteouſnes: And moreouer, that it is not onely weake and beggerly, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and beggery it ſelfe. How then ſhall it enrich or ſtrengthen thoſe, which were before both weake and beggerly? Therefore to ſeeke to be iuſtified by the lawe, is as much as if a man being weake and feeble

                  <p>Now, who would haue thought that the Galathians,<note place="margin">Falling avvay from the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is very eaſie.</note> which had learned ſo ſound and ſo pure a doctrine of ſuch an excellent Apoſtle and teacher, could be ſo ſuddenly ledde away from the ſame, and vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruerted by the falſe Apoſtles? It is not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out cauſe that I repete this ſo often: that to fall away from the truth of the Goſpel is an eaſie matter. The reaſon is, becauſe men doe not ſufficiently conſider, no not the very faithfull, what an excellent and a precious treaſure the true knowledge of Chriſt is. Therefore they doe not labour ſo diligently &amp; ſo carefully as they ſhould doe, to obtaine &amp; to retaine the ſame. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the greater part of thoſe that heare the word, are exerciſed with no croſſe or affliction: they wraſtle not againſt ſinne, death &amp; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, but liue in ſecuritie without any conflict.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> hath here his peculier maner of ſpeech,<note place="margin">Paules maner of ſpeech.</note> which the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did not vſe.

And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I durſt not haue geuen ſuch termes vnto the lawe, but ſhould haue thought it great blaſphemy againſt God, if <hi>Paule</hi> had not ſo done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But of this I haue entreated more largely before, where I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the lawe is weake and beggerly, and when it is moſt ſtrong and rich. &amp;c. Now,<note place="margin">If the lavve of God be vveak and not able to obtaine righteouſnes, much more the Popes traditions.</note> if the law of God be weake and vnprofitable to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, much more are the lawes and decrees of the Pope, weake and vnprofitable to Iuſtification. Therefore we geue ſentence againſt the ordinaunces, lawes and decrees of the Pope with ſuch boldnes &amp; aſſurance as <hi>Paule</hi> did againſt the law of God, that they are not onely weake and beggerly rudiments, and vtterly vnprofitable to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but alſo execrable, accurſed, deuiliſh &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable: for they blaſpheme grace, they ouerthrow the Goſpel, aboliſh faith, take away Chriſt. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For as much then as the Pope requireth that we ſhould kepe his

                  <p>This place which <hi>Paule</hi> here handleth, is weightie and of great importance,<note place="margin">To fall from the grace of God.</note> and therefore the more diligently to be marked: to witte, that they which fall from grace to the law, doe vtterly loſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth: they ſee not their owne ſinnes: they neither know God nor the Deuill, nor them ſelues: and moreouer they vnderſtand not the force and vſe of the lawe,<note place="margin">VVhat iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they geue of the lavve, that knovv not Chriſte.</note> although they bragge neuer ſo much that they keepe and obſerue the ſame.

But he rather iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth quite contrary of the law: to witte, that it is not onely neceſſary to ſaluation, but alſo that it ſtrengthneth ſuch as are weake, and enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth ſuch as are poore and beggerly: that is to ſay, that ſuch as obey and obſerue the ſame, ſhall be able to merite righteouſnes and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſaluation.

                  <p>Hetherto <hi>Paule</hi> hath ben occupied wholy in teaching, and being moued with this great enormitie and wicked reuolting of the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, he was veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly incenſed againſt them, and chid them bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, calling them fooles, bewitched, not beleuing the truth, crucifiers of Chriſt, &amp;c. Now, the greater part of his Epiſtle being finiſhed,<note place="margin">The Apoſtle novv ſpeketh them faire, vvhom before he did ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chide.</note> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to perceiue that he had handled them too ſharply.

                  <p>And here by his owne example he admoniſheth all Paſtours and Miniſters, that they ought to beare a fatherly and motherly affection:<note place="margin">A right patern of a godly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour.</note> not towardes rauening wolues, but towardes the poore ſheepe, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ſeduced and going aſtray, patiently bearing with their faultes and infirmities,<note place="margin">Galath. 6.1.</note> inſtructing and reſtoring them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſpirite of meke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: For they can not be brought into the right way againe by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes: and by ouer ſharpe reprouing and rebuking they are prouoked to anger, or elſe to deſperation, but not to repentaunce. And here is to be noted by the way, that ſuch is the nature and frute of true and ſound doctrine, that when it is well taught and well vnderſtand,<note place="margin">The frute of ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d doctrine.</note> it ioyneth mens hearts together with a ſinguler concord: but when men reiect godly and ſincere doctrine, and embrace errors, this vnitie and concord is ſoone broken.<note place="margin">The agrement of mindes is broken by vvicked do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> Therfore as ſoone as thou ſeeſt thy brethern ſeduced by vaine and fantaſticall ſpirites, to fall from the article of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, thou ſhalt perceiue that by and by they wil purſue the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with bitter hatred, whom before they moſt tenderly loued.</p>
                  <p>This we find to be true at this day in our falſe brethern and other Sectaries, who at the beginning of the reformation of the Goſpell, were glad to heare vs, and redde our Bookes with great zeale and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. They acknowledged the grace of the holy Ghoſt in vs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced vs for the ſame as the miniſters of God. Some of them alſo liued familiarly with vs for a time, and behaued them ſelues very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
<pb facs="tcp:9456:202"/>
and ſoberly.<note place="margin">They vvhich fall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſound doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vvorſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vver before.</note> But when they were departed from vs and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the wicked doctrine of the Sectaries, they ſhewed them ſelues more bitter enemies to our doctrine &amp; our name then any other. I doe much and often maruell whervpon they ſhould conceiue ſuch a deadly hatred againſt vs, whom they before ſo dearly and ſo tenderly loued: For we offended them not in any thing, nor gaue them any occaſion to hate vs. Yea they are conſtrained to confeſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we deſire nothing more then that the glory of God may be aduaunced, the benefite of Chriſte truely knowne, and the truth of the Goſpel purely taught: which God hath now againe in theſe later dayes reueiled by vs vnto this vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full world: which thing ſhould rather prouoke them to loue vs then to hate vs. I maruel therfore not without cauſe, wherof this chaunge co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. Verely there is no other cauſe, but that they haue gotten vnto them ſelues new maſters &amp; harkened to new teachers, whoſe poyſon hath ſo infected the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that now of very frends they are become our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemies.<note place="margin">The conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</note> And I ſee the condition of the Apoſtles &amp; all other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miniſters to be ſuch, that their diſciples and hearers being once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the errours of the falſe Apoſtles and heretikes, haue &amp; doe ſet them ſelues againſt them, and become their enemies. There were very fewe amongſt the Galathians which continued in the ſound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Apoſtle: All the reſt being ſeduced by the falſe apoſtles, did not acknowledge <hi>Paule</hi> for their paſtour and teacher any more: yea there was nothing more odious vnto them then the name and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Paule.</hi> And I feare me that this Epiſtle brought very few of them backe againe from their errour.</p>
                  <p>If the like caſe ſhould happen vnto vs: that is to ſay, if in our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence our Church ſhould be ſeduced by fantaſticall heads, &amp; we ſhould wryte hither, not one or two, but many Epiſtles: we ſhould preuaile litle or nothing at all. Our men (a few onely excepted of the ſtronger ſort) would vſe themſelues no otherwiſe towardes vs, then they doe at this day which are ſeduced by the Sectaries: who would ſooner wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Pope, then they would obey our admonitions or approue our doctrine. No man ſhall perſwade them that they, reiecting Chriſt, doe returne againe to weake and beggerly elementes, &amp; to thoſe which by nature are no Gods. They can abide nothing leſſe, then to heare that their teachers by whom they are ſeduced, are ouerthrowers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, and troublers of mens conſciences. The Lutherans (ſay they) are not onely wiſe, they alone doe not preach Chriſte, they alone haue not the holy Ghoſt, the gift of propheſie, and the true vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

of the Scriptures.<note place="margin">The Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts bragge altogether of the ſpirite, of illuminations &amp; reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> Our teachers are in nothing inferiour vnto them: yea in many things they excell them, becauſe they folowe the ſpirite and teach ſpirituall things. Contrariwiſe they neuer yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted what true Diuinitie ment, but ſticke in the letter, and therefore they teach nothing but the Catechiſme, Faith, and charity. &amp;c.

Therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> later ende of thoſe men is worſe then the beginning: As our Sauiour Chriſt witneſſeth when he ſayth: The vncleane ſpirit being caſt out of his houſe, when he returneth he entreth in againe not alone, but taketh vnto him ſeuen ſpirits worſe then himſelfe, and there dwelleth. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> therefore perceauing through the reuelation of the holy Ghoſt, that it was to be feared leſt the mindes of the Galathians, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a godly zeale he had called foliſh and bewitched. &amp;c. ſhould rather by this ſharpe chiding be more ſtirred vppe againſt him then amended, (eſpecially ſince he now knew that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſe apoſtles were among them, who would expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this ſharpe chiding which proceded from a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection to the worſt, and would crie out: Now, <hi>Paule</hi> which ſome of you ſo greatly praiſe, ſheweth what he is, and with what ſpirit he is led: when he was w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you he would ſeme to be vnto you a father, but his letters ſhew in his abſence that he is a tyranne. &amp;c.) therefore he is ſo troubled through a godly care &amp; fatherly affection, that he can not well tell how and what to wryte to them. For it is a dangerous thing for a man to defend his cauſe with thoſe which are abſent and haue now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to hate him, who alſo be perſwaded by others that his cauſe is not good.

                  <p>But why ſayth <hi>Paule,</hi> that he was not deſpiſed of the Galathians?

                  <p>This is therfore a great commendation of the Galathians,<note place="margin">The praiſe of the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> that they were not offended with this infirmitie and tentation of <hi>Paule,</hi> but receaued him as an Angell of God, yea as Chriſt Ieſus.

Wherefore, by theſe wordes he highly commendeth the vertue of the Galathians, which he ſayeth, he will kepe in perpetuall remembraunce, and ſo much eſtemeth the ſame, that he deſireth it may be knowne vnto all men.

                  <p>In that Agar conceaued and brought forth Iſmael, there was no word of God that foreſhewed that thys ſhould come to paſſe: but by the permiſſion of Sara, <hi>Abraham</hi> went in to his ſeruaunt Agar, whom Sara being barren had geuen to wife to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as is ſayd in the booke of Geneſis.<note place="margin">Sara had hard the promiſe of God as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſede, but she vvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not gods appoynted time.</note> For Sara had heard that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> by the promiſe of God, ſhould haue ſeede of his body, and ſhe hoped that ſhe ſhould be the mother of this ſeede.

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Arabians language ſignifieth as much as an handmaid: and I thinke the likenes of this name gaue <hi>Paule</hi> light and occaſion to ſeeke out this allegorie.<note place="margin">Agar brought forth a ſonne, not an heire but a ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> Likewiſe then as Agar the bondmaid brought forth to <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſonne, and yet not an heire but a ſeruaunt, ſo Sina the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legoricall Agar, brought forth to God a ſonne, that is to ſay, a carnall people.

                     <note place="margin">Sina brought vnto God a ſonne, but a carnal people.</note> ſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael had the true God to be their father, which gaue them his law, his oracles, religion and true ſeruice, and the temple: as it is ſaid in the Pſalme. <hi>147: He shevveth his vvord vnto Iacob, his ſtatutes and his iudgements vnto Iſrael.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 147.19.</note> Notwithſtanding this onely was the difference: Iſmael was borne of a bondmaid after the fleſh, that is to ſay, without the promiſe, and could not therfore be the heire.

For the promiſes as touching Chriſt the geuer of all Bleſſing, and as touching the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the curſe of the law, from ſinne and death: alſo as touching the free remiſſion of our ſinnes, of righteouſnes and euerlaſting life, are not added to the lawe, but the lawe ſayth:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.5.</note>

Theſe are the heauenly bleſſings which Chriſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to his Church.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore Ieruſalem which is aboue, that is to ſay, the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ieruſalem is the church which is now in the world: and not the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the life to come,<note place="margin">The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Monkes.</note> or the Church triumphant, as the idle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Monks and the Schooledoctors dreamed, which taught that the Scripture hath foure ſenſes: the literall ſenſe, the figuratiue ſenſe, the allegoricall ſenſe,<note place="margin">The foure ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Papiſtes.</note> and the morall ſenſe, and according to theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they haue fooliſhly interpreted almoſt all the wordes of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

But <hi>Paule</hi> ſayeth here that the olde and earthly Ieruſalem belongeth vnto Agar,<note place="margin">The heauenly Ieruſalem vvhich is yet vpon earth.</note> and that it is in bondage with her children, and is vtterly aboliſhed. But the new and heauenly Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which is a Queene and a freewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is appoynted of god in earth and not in heauen, to be the mother of vs all, of whom we haue bene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:9456:215"/>
and yet daily are gendred. Therefore it is neceſſary that this our mother ſhould be in earth among men, as alſo her generation is. Notwithſtanding ſhe gendreth by the holy Ghoſt, by the miniſtery of the word and ſacraments, and not in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>This I ſay to the ende that in this matter we ſhould not be caried away with our cogitations into heauen, but that we ſhould know that <hi>Paule</hi> ſetteth the Ieruſalem which is aboue,<note place="margin">The heauenly Ieruſalem is ſet againſt the earthly, not locally but ſpiritually.</note> againſt the earthly Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, not locally but ſpiritually. For there is a diſtinction betwene thoſe things which are ſpirituall, and thoſe which are corporall or earthly. The ſpirituall things are aboue, the earthly are beneath: So Ieruſalem which is aboue, is diſtinguiſhed from the carnall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Ieruſalem which is beneath, not locally (as I haue ſayd) but ſpiritually. For this ſpirituall Ieruſalem which tooke her beginning in the corporall Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">The ſpirituall Ieruſalem diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovv out the vvhole vvorld</note> hath not any certaine place as hath the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Iudea: but it is diſperſed thorow out the whole world, and may be in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in <hi>Turkie,</hi> in <hi>Tartarie,</hi> in <hi>Scythia,</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi> in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> in the Iſles of the ſea, in the mountaines and valleis, and in all places of the world where men dwel which haue the Goſpel and beleue in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore Sara or Ieruſalem our free mother, is the Church it ſelfe, the ſpouſe of Chriſte, of whom we all are gendred. This mother gendreth free children without ceaſing to the ende of the world, as long as ſhe exerciſeth the Miniſterie of the word, that is to ſay, as long as ſhe preacheth and publiſheth the Goſpell: for this is truely to gender. Now, ſhe teacheth the Goſpell after this maner: to witte, that we are deliuered from the Curſe of the lawe, from ſinne, death and all other euils through Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; not by the law, neither by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. Therefore Ieruſalem which is aboue, that is to ſay, the Church, is not ſubiect to the law and works, but ſhe is free and a mother, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the law, ſinne and death. Now, ſuch a mother as ſhe is, ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhe gendreth.</p>
                  <p>This allegorie teacheth very aptly that the Church ſhould doe nothing elſe but preach and teach the Goſpell truely and ſincerely,<note place="margin">The Church begetteth children by teaching.</note> and by this meanes ſhould gender children. So, we are all fathers and children one to an other: For we are begotten one of an other. I being begotten by other through the Goſpell, doe now beget other, which ſhall alſo beget other hereafter: and ſo this begetting ſhall endure to the ende of the world. Now, I ſpeake of the generation, not of Agar the bondmaid, which gendreth her bondſeruauntes by
<pb facs="tcp:9456:216"/>
the lawe, but of Sara the freewoman, who gendreth heires without the law, and without mans workes or endeuours. For in that Iſaac is heire and not Iſmael (albeit notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that both of them were the naturall ſonnes of Abraham) Iſaac had the inheritaunce by the word of promiſe,<note place="margin">Iſaac is heir through the promiſe. <hi>Geneſ. 17.19.</hi>
                     </note> namely: <hi>Sara thy vvife shall bring thee a ſonne, and thou shalt call his name Iſaac.</hi> This did Sara well vnderſtand, and therefore ſhe ſayeth: <hi>Caſt out the bondvvoman and her ſonne:</hi> And <hi>Paule</hi> alſo aledgeth theſe words afterwards. Wherfore as Iſaac hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inheritance of his father onely by the promiſe and by his birth, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the law and without works: euen ſo we are borne through the Goſpel of that freewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sara, true heires of the promiſe.

So all things are done by the miniſterie of the word. Wherefore the office of the freewoman is to gender children to God her huſband with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing and without end: that is to ſay, ſuch children as know that they are iuſtified by Faith and not by the lawe.</p>

and forſaken, hauing no children: but before God he ſayth ſhe is frute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and therfore he biddeth her reioyce. As though he would ſay:<note place="margin">The church barren before the vvorld.</note> Thou art in deede forſaken and barren, and haſt not the law for thy huſband, and therefore thou haſt no children.

But although ſhe ſeeme to be neuer ſo barren without the law and without workes, yet notwithſtanding ſhe is moſt frutefull before God, &amp; bringeth forth an infinite nombre of children, not in bondage but in freedome. By what meanes? Not by the lawe, but by the word and ſpirite of Ieſus Chriſt which is geuen by the Goſpell, through which ſhe conceaueth, bringeth forth and nouriſheth her children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> therefore plainly ſheweth by this allegory the difference betwixt the law and the Goſpell:<note place="margin">The difference betvvixt the lavv and the goſpell.</note> Firſt when he calleth Agar the olde Teſtament, and Sara the newe: Againe, when he calleth the one a bondmaind, the other a freewoman: Moreouer, when he ſayeth that the maried &amp; frutefull is become barren and caſt out of the houſe with her children. Contrariwiſe the barren and forſaken is become frutefull, &amp; bringeth forth an infinite no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of children, &amp; thoſe alſo inheritours. By theſe differences are reſembled the two ſortes of people, of Faith &amp; of the law I meane. The people of Faith haue not the lawe for their huſband, they ſerue not in bondage, they are not borne of that mother Ieruſalem which now is: but they haue the promiſe, they are free, and are borne of free Sara.</p>
                  <p>He ſeparateth therefore the ſpirituall people of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the other people of the lawe, when he ſayeth that the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall people are not the children of Agar the bondmaid, but of Sara the freewoman, which knoweth nothing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law. And by this meanes he placeth the people of faith farre aboue and without the law. Now, if they be aboue and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the law, then are they iuſtified by the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall birth onely, which is nothing elſe but Faith: and not by the lawe or by the workes thereof. Now, as the people of grace, neither haue, nor can haue the lawe: ſo the people of the lawe neither haue nor can
<pb facs="tcp:9456:218"/>
haue grace:<note place="margin">The people of grace vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the lavve, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the lavv vvithout grace.</note> for it is impoſſible that the lawe and grace ſhould ſtand together. Therfore we muſt be iuſtified by faith, &amp; loſe the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the law: or elſe be iuſtified by the law, and loſe the righteouſnes of Faith. But this is a fowle and a lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table loſſe, to loſe grace and to returne to the lawe. Contrariwiſe it is an happie and bleſſed loſſe, to loſe the lawe, and lay hold of grace.</p>
                  <p>We therefore (folowing the example and diligence of <hi>Paule</hi>) doe endeuour as much as is poſſible, to ſet forth plainly the difference betwixt the lawe and the Goſpell: which is very eaſie as touching the wordes. For who ſeeth not that Agar is not Sara, and that Sara is not Agar? Alſo, that Iſmael is not Iſaac, and that he hath not that which Iſaac hath? A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may eaſily diſcerne theſe things: but in great terrours and in the agonie of death, when the conſcience wraſtleth with the iudgement of God, it is the hardeſt thing of all others to ſay with a ſure and a ſtedfaſt hope: I am not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of Agar, but of Sara: that is to ſay, the law belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth nothing vnto me: For Sara is my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who bringeth forth free children and heirs, and not ſeruaunts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> then by this teſtimonie of Eſay hath proued that Sara, that is to ſay, the church is the true mother which bringeth forth free children &amp; heires: Contrariwiſe that Agar, that is to ſay, the ſinagoge gendreth many children in deede: but they are ſeruauntes and muſt be caſt out. Moreouer, becauſe this place ſpeaketh alſo of the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the lawe and of Chriſtian libertie, it ought to be diligently conſidered. For as it is the moſt principall and ſpeciall article of Chriſtian doctrine, to know that we are iuſtified and ſaued by Chriſte, ſo is it alſo very neceſſary to knowe and vnderſtand well the doctrine concerning the aboliſhment of the lawe. For it helpeth very much to confirme our doctrine as touching Faith, and to attaine ſound and certaine conſolation of conſcience, when we are aſſured that the lawe is aboliſhed, and ſpecially in great terrours and ſerious conflicts.</p>
                  <p>I haue often ſayd before, and now I ſay againe (for it can not be too often repeted), that a Chriſtian laying holde of the benefit of Chriſte through Faith,<note place="margin">The lavve is abolished to all chriſtians.</note> hath no lawe, but all the lawe is to him aboliſhed with all his terrours and tormentes. This place of Eſay teacheth the ſame thing, and therefore it is very notable and full of comfort, ſtirring vp the barren and forſaken to reioyce, which was counted worthy to be mocked or pitied according to the lawe. For ſuch as were barren were accurſed according to the lawe: but the holy Ghoſt turneth this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and pronounceth the barren worthy of praiſe and Bleſſing: and

<pb facs="tcp:9456:219"/>
which the other two doe not. Wherefore we ſay that the Morall lawe, or the lawe of the ten commaundements hath no power to accuſe and terrifie the conſcience, in which Ieſus Chriſte raigneth by his grace: for he hath aboliſhed the power therof.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9456:227"/>
with all his power.</p>

                  <p>Of this libertie there foloweth an other, whereby through Chriſte we are made free from the lawe, ſinne, death, the power of the Deuill, hell, &amp;c. For as the wrath of God can not terrifie vs for that Chriſte hath deliuered vs from the ſame: ſo the lawe, ſinne and death, can not accuſe and condemne vs. And although the law accuſe vs and ſinne terrifie vs, yet they can not driue vs to deſperation. For Faith, which ouercometh the world, by and by ſayeth: Theſe things belong not vnto me: for Chriſte hath made me free, and deliuered me from them all. Likewiſe death which is the moſt mighty and moſt dreadful thing in all the world, is vtterly vanquiſhed in the conſcience by this libertie of the ſpirite. Wherfore the maieſtie of this Chriſtian libertie is highly to be eſtemed, and diligently conſidered.

                  <p>Therfore our conſcience muſt be enſtructed and prepared before hand, that when we feele the accuſation of the lawe, the terrours of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:9456:227"/>
ſinne, the horrour of death and the wrath of God, we may remoue theſe heauie ſightes and fearfull fantaſies out of our mindes,<note place="margin">A remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the minde in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> and ſet in the place thereof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> freedome purchaſed by Chriſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forgeuenes of ſinnes, righteouſnes, life and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euerlaſting mercy of god.

Wherefore that libertie which Chriſt hath purchaſed for vs, is not ſo ſoone beleued as it is named. If it could be apprehended with a ſure and a ſtedfaſt Faith, then no rage or terrour of the word, of the law, ſinne, death or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Deuill could be ſo great, but by &amp; by it ſhould be ſwalowed vp as a litle drop of water is ſwallowed of the maine ſea. And certainly this Chriſtian libertie ſwalloweth vp at once &amp; taketh quite away the whole heape of euils, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, ſinne, death, Gods wrath, and briefly the ſerpent him ſelfe, with his head and whole power, and in the ſtead therof it placeth righteouſnes, peace &amp; euerlaſting life,<note place="margin">Luke. 11 28.

                  <p>Let vs learne therefore to magnifie this our libertie purchaſed by Ieſus Chriſte the ſonne of God,<note place="margin">Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</note> by whom all things were created both in heauen and earth.

For they vaunt that they alſo haue this libertie, and they promiſe the ſame vnto others: but in very deede they are the ſeruauntes of corruption, and in the time of tentation all their vaine confidence vaniſheth away euen in a moment.

They (ſayth he) that teach the law after this ſort, do not ſet mens conſciences at libertie, but ſnare and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle them with a yoke, yea and that with a yoke of bondage.</p>
                  <p>He ſpeaketh therfore of the law very baſely and contemptuouſly, and calleth it an hard bondage and a ſeruile yoke. And this he doth not without great cauſe. For this pernicious opinion of the lawe, that it iuſtifieth and maketh men righteous before God, is deepely rooted in mans reaſon, and all mankinde is ſo wrapped in it, that it can hardly get out. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemeth here to compare thoſe that ſeeke righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by the lawe, vnto oxen that be tied to the yoke,<note place="margin">Thei that ſeke righteouſnes by the lavve, are compared to oxen tied to the yoke.</note> to the end he might take from it the glory of iuſtifying &amp; of righteouſnes.

For as we haue often ſayd before, the law doth but reueale, encreaſe &amp; aggrauate ſinne, accuſe, terrify, condemne, &amp; gender wrath, and finally it driueth poore conſciences into deſperation, which is the moſt miſerable and moſt greeuous bondage that can be Rom. 3.4.5.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:9456:229"/>He vſeth therefore very vehement wordes. For he would gladly perſwade them that they ſhould not ſuffer this importable burden to be layd vpon their ſhoulders by the falſe apoſtles, or be entangled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with the yoke of bondage. As if he ſhould ſay: We ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not here vpon a matter of ſmall importance, but either of euerlaſting libertie, or euerlaſting bondage. For like as freedome from Gods wrath and all euils is not temporall or carnall, but euerlaſting: euen ſo the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſinne, death, the Deuill and damnation (wherwith all they be oppreſſed which will be made righteous and ſaued by the law) is not corporall and ſuch as continueth but for a time, but euerlaſting. For ſuch workers of the lawe as goe about to performe and accompliſh all things preciſely and exactly (for of ſuch <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh) can neuer finde quietnes and peace of conſcience in this life. They alwayes dout of the good will of God towardes them: they are alwayes in feare of death, of the wrath and iudgement of God: and after this life they ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be puniſhed for their vnbeleefe with euerlaſting damnation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the doers of the lawe, and ſuch as ſtand altogether vpon the righteouſnes and workes thereof, are rightly called the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils martyrs.<note place="margin">VVho be the Deuils Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</note> They take more paines and puniſh them ſelues more in purchaſing hell (according to the prouerbe) then the Martyrs of Chriſte doe in obtaining heauen.

This is a very hard ſentence: wherby <hi>Paule</hi> declareth, that, to be circumciſed, is as much as to make Chriſte vtterly vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: not in reſpect of himſelfe, but of the Galathians, who being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued by the ſubtelties of the falſe apoſtles, beleued that, beſides faith in Chriſte, it was needefull for the faithfull to be circumciſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which they could not obtaine ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>This place is as it were a touchſtone, wherby we may moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely and freely iudge of all doctrines, workes,<note place="margin">The iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the godly touching all doctrines, religions and ceremonies.</note> religions and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of all men.

Seing <hi>Paule</hi> durſt geue this ſentence againſt the lawe and circumciſion, which were ordained of God himſelfe, what durſt he not doe againſt the chaffe and the droſſe of mens traditions?</p>
                  <p>Wherefore this place is a terrible thunderbolt againſt all the kingdom of the Pope. For all the Prieſtes, Monkes,<note place="margin">VVho they be to vvhom Chriſt is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</note> and Heremites that liue in their cloiſters (I ſpeake of the beſt of them) repoſed all their truſt and confidence in their owne workes, righteouſnes, vowes and merits, and not in Chriſt, whom they moſt wickedly and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly imagined to be an angrie iudge, an accuſer and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demner: And therefore here they heare their iudgement, that Chriſt profiteth them
<pb facs="tcp:9456:230"/>
nothing. For if they can put away ſinnes and deſerue forgeuenes of ſinnes and euerlaſting life through their owne righteouſnes and ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of life: then to what purpoſe was Chriſte borne? What profite haue they by his death and bloudſheding, by his reſurrection, victorie ouer ſinne, death and the Deuill, ſeeing they are able to ouercome theſe monſters by their owne ſtrength? And what tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge can expreſſe, or what heart can conceaue how horrible a thing it is to make Chriſt vnprofitable? Therefore the Apoſtle caſteth out theſe wordes with great diſpleaſure and indignation: <hi>If ye be circumciſed, Chriſt shall profite you nothing:</hi> that is to ſay, no profite ſhall redound vnto you of all his benefites: but he hath beſtowed them all vppon you in vaine.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it appeareth ſufficiently that nothing vnder the ſonne is more hurtfull then the doctrine of mens traditions and workes: for they vtterly aboliſh and ouerthrow at once the truth of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Nothing is more hurtfull then the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of mens traditions &amp; vvorkes. <hi>Coloſſ. 2.3.

Who ſo is not moued with theſe wordes of <hi>Paule</hi> (which calleth the lawe a yoke of bondage,<note place="margin">The lavve of God the yoke of bondage.</note> and ſayth that they which affirme the keeping of circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be neceſſary to ſaluation, make Chriſt vnprofitable): and can not be driuen from the lawe and circumciſion, nor yet from the confidence which he hath in his owne righteouſnes and workes, nor be ſtirred vp to ſeeke that libertie which is in Chriſte, his heart is harder then ſtone and iron.</p>
                  <p>This is therfore a moſt certaine and cleare ſentence, that Chriſt is vnprofitable, that is to ſay, he is borne, crucified and riſen againe in vaine to him that is circumciſed, that is, which putteth his truſt in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. For (as I haue ſayd before) <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh not here of the worke of circumciſion (which hurteth not him that hath no affiance or opinion of righteouſnes in it):<note place="margin">Good vvorks are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but confidence in good vvorks is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned.</note> but of the vſe of the worke, that is to ſay of the confidence and righteouſnes that is annexed to the worke: For we muſt vnderſtand <hi>Paule</hi> according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter wherof he intreateth, or according to the argument which he hath in hand: which is, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:9456:230"/>
be not iuſtified by the lawe, by works, by circumciſion or ſuch like. He ſayth not that workes of them ſelues are nothing, but the confidence &amp; righteouſnes of workes are nothing: for that maketh Chriſte vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. Therfore who ſo receaueth circumciſion with this opinion that it is neceſſary to iuſtification, to him Chriſt auaileth nothing.</p>
                  <p>Let vs beare this well in minde in our priuate tentations when the Deuill accuſeth and terrifieth our conſcience to driue it to deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For he is the father of lying and the enemie of Chriſtian liberty: therfore he tormenteth vs euery moment with falſe feares, that when our conſcience hath loſt this Chriſtian libertie, it ſhould feele the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of ſinne and condenmation, and alwayes remaine in auguiſh and terrour. When that great dragon (I ſay) that old ſerpent the Deuill (who deceaueth the whole world and accuſeth our brethern in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God day and night. Apoc. 12.) commeth and layeth vnto thy charge that thou haſt not onely done no good,<note place="margin">Reuel. 12.10.</note> but haſt alſo tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the law of God, ſay vnto him:<note place="margin">VVhat vve muſt anſvver the Deuill, vvhen he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth and tempteth vs.</note> Thou troubleſt me with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my ſinnes paſt: Thou putteſt me alſo in minde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue done no good. But this is nothing to me: for if either I truſted in mine own good dedes, or diſtruſted becauſe I haue done none, Chriſt ſhould both waies profite me nothing at all. Therfore whether thou lay my ſinnes before me, or my good workes, I paſſe not, but remouing both farre out of my ſight, I onely reſt in that libertie wherein Chriſt hath made me free. I know him to be profitable vnto me: therfore I will not make him vnprofitable: which I ſhould doe, if either I ſhould preſume to purchaſe my ſelfe fauour and euerlaſting life by my good deedes, or ſhould deſpaire of my ſaluation becauſe of my ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let vs learne with all diligence to ſeparate Chriſte farre from all works, as well good as euil: from all lawes both of God and man, and from all troubled conſciences: for with all theſe Chriſte hath nothing to doe. He hath to doe, I graunt, with afflicted conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: howbeit not to afflict them more, but to raiſe them vp, and in their affliction to comfort them. Therfore if Chriſte appeare in the likenes of an angry iudge, or of a lawmaker that requireth a ſtrait accompt of our life paſt: then let vs aſſure our ſelues that it is not Chriſt but a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging feende. For the Scripture painteth out Chriſt to be our reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, our aduocate and our comforter.<note place="margin">The true pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Chriſt</note> Such a one he is and euer ſhal be: he can not be vnlike himſelfe.</p>

This is to goe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward like the crabbe, and to waſh away filth with filth.</p>
                  <p>And this which I ſay by occaſion of <hi>Paules</hi> words, I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both in my ſelfe and others. I haue ſeene many which haue pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully trauailed, and vppon mere conſcience haue done as much as was poſſible for them to doe, in faſting, in prayer, in wearing of heare, in puniſhing and tormenting their bodies with ſundry exerciſes (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by at length they muſt needes haue vtterly conſumed them,<note place="margin">The conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is not quieted and pacified vvith the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of mans tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had ben made of iron), and all to this end that they might obtaine quietnes and peace of conſcience: notwithſtanding, the more they trauailed, the more they were ſtricken down w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> feare, &amp; ſpecially when the houre of death approched they were ſo fearfull, that I haue ſeene many murtherers and other male factours condemned to death, dying more couragiouſly then they did: which notwithſtanding had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued very holily.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is moſt true, that they which doe the lawe, doe it not: For the more they goe about to fulfill the lawe, the more they tranſgreſſe it. Euen ſo we ſay and iudge of mens traditions. The more a man ſtriueth to pacifie his conſcience therby, the more he troubleth and tormenteth it. When I was a Monke, I endeuored as much as was poſſible, to liue after the ſtreit rule of mine Order. I was wont to ſhriue my ſelfe with great deuotion, and to recken vp all my ſinnes (yet being alwayes very contrite before): and I returned to confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very often, and throughly performed the penaunce that was enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto me: Yet for all this my conſcience could neuer be fully certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but was alwayes in doubt, and ſayd: This or that thou haſt not done rightly: thou waſt not contrite and ſorrowfull inough: this ſinne thou diddeſt omitte in thy confeſſion, &amp;c. Therefore the more I went about to helpe my weake, wauering and afflicted conſcience by mens traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the more weake and doubtfull, and the more afflicted I was. And thus, the more I obſerued mens traditions, the more I tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, and in ſeeking after righteouſnes by mine Order, I could neuer attaine vnto it. For it is impoſſible (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſayeth) that the conſcience ſhould be pacified by the workes of the lawe, and much
<pb facs="tcp:9456:232"/>
leſſe by mens traditions, without the promiſe and glad tidings concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſte.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore they that ſeeke to be iuſtified and quickned by the law, are much further of from righteouſnes and life, then the Publicanes, ſinners and harlots. For they can not truſt to their owne works, ſeing they be ſuch, for the which they can not hope to obtaine grace and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes of ſinnes.<note place="margin">Confidence in vvorks vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay Faith, or at leaſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth it in vs.</note> For if righteouſnes &amp; works done according to the lawe doe not iuſtifie, how can ſinnes iuſtifie which are committed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the lawe? Therefore in this poynt they are in farre better caſe then the Iuſticiaries: for they haue no affiance in theyr owne workes: which greatly hindreth true Faith in Chriſte, if it doe not vtterly take it away. Contrariwiſe the Iuſticiaries which abſtaine outwardly from ſinnes, and liue holily and without blame in the ſight of the world, can not be without the opinion of their owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, with the which true Faith in Chriſte can not ſtande: And for this cauſe they be more miſerable then Publicanes and harlotes,<note place="margin">Iuſticiaries &amp; meritmongers vvill be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For by the ſame reaſon that thou art bound to keepe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, thou art alſo bound to kepe the whole lawe.

But the whole Scripture witneſſeth, and the ſequele thereof plainely declareth that Chriſte is already come, that by his death he hath redemed mankinde, that he hath aboliſhed the lawe, and that he hath fulfilled all things which all the Prophetes haue foretolde of him. Therefore the lawe being cleane aboliſhed and quite taken away, he hath geuen vnto vs grace and truth. It is not then the lawe nor the workes thereof, but it is Faith in Ieſus Chriſte, that maketh a man righteous.</p>

                  <p>The former expoſition: that is to ſay, the negatiue ſeemeth to me to be more apte and more ſpirituall: notwythſtanding both are good, and both doe condemne the righteouſnes of the lawe. The firſt is, that we are ſo farre from obtaining righteouſnes of the lawe, that the more we goe about to accompliſh the law, the more we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the lawe: The ſecond is: that he which will performe any peece of the lawe, is bound to kepe the whole lawe: To conclude, that Chriſte profiteth them nothing at all that will be iuſtified by the lawe.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it appeareth that <hi>Paule</hi> meaneth nothing elſe, but that the lawe is a plaine deniall of Chriſte. Now,<note place="margin">They that ſeke to be iuſtified by the lavve, deny Chriſt.</note> it is a wonderfull thing that <hi>Paule</hi> dare affirme, that the lawe of Moiſes which was geuen by God to the people of Iſraell, is a deniall of Chriſte. Why then did God geue it? Before the comming of Chriſte, and before his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation in the fleſh, the lawe was neceſſary. For the lawe is our Schoolemaſter to bring vs vnto Chriſte.

Therfore, ſayeth he, ye are aboliſhed: that is, ye are vtterly voide of Chriſte, Chriſte is not in you, he worketh not in you any more: Ye are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the knowledge, the ſpirit, the felowſhip, the fauour, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the life, or the doings of Chriſte, but ye are vtterly ſeperate from him, ſo that he hath no more to doe with you, nor ye with him.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Chriſte and the lavve can not dvvell together.</note>Theſe wordes of <hi>Paule</hi> are diligently to be noted: that to ſeeke righteouſnes by the lawe, is nothing elſe but to be ſeperated from Chriſte, and to make him vtterly vnprofitable. What can be ſpoken more mightely againſt the lawe? what can be ſette againſt this thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolte.

I neither take from good workes their praiſe, nor commend euill works. But in the matter of iuſtification, I ſay, we muſt looke how we may hold Chriſt, leſt if we ſeeke to be iuſtified by the lawe, we make him vnprofitable vnto vs. For it is Chriſte alone that iuſtifieth me, both againſt my euill deedes, and without my good deedes.

                     <hi>Paule</hi> here knitteth vppe the matter with a notable concluſion, ſaying: Ye will be iuſtified by the lawe, by circumciſion and by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: but we ſeeke not to be iuſtified by this meanes, leſt Chriſt ſhould be made vtterly vnprofitable vnto vs: and we become detters to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the whole lawe, and ſo finally fall away from grace: but we waite in ſpirite through Faith for the hope of righteouſnes. Euery word is here diligently to be noted, for they are pithie and full of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. He doth not only ſay, as he is wont: We are iuſtified by Faith, or in ſpirite by Faith, but moreouer he addeth: <hi>VVe vvaite for the hope of righteouſnes,</hi> including hope alſo, that he may comprehend the whole matter of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Hope, after the maner of the Scriptures, is taken two wayes: for the thing that is hoped for, &amp; for the affection of him that hopeth. For the thing which is hoped for, it is taken in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> firſt chapt. to the Coloſs:<note place="margin">Verſe. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>For the hopes ſake vvhich is layed vppe for you in heauen:</hi> that is to ſay, the thing which ye hope for. For the affection of him that hopeth, it is taken in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 8 chap. to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaines: <hi>For vve are ſaued by hope.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 14.25.</note> So hope in this place alſo may be taken two wayes, and ſo it yeldeth a double ſenſe. The firſt is: We waite in ſpirite through Faith for the hope of righteouſnes, that is to ſay, the righteouſnes hoped for, which ſhall be certainely reuealed in ſuch time as it pleaſeth the Lord to geue it. The ſecond: We wait in ſpirite by Faith for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes with hope and deſire: that is to ſay, we are righteous: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit our righteouſnes is not yet reuealed, but hangeth yet in hope. For, as long as we liue here, ſinne remaineth in our fleſh:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.24. Rom. 7.15.16.17 Rom. 7.23.</note> there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a lawe in our fleſh and members rebelling againſt the lawe of our minde, and leading vs captiues vnto the ſeruice of ſinne. Now when theſe affections of the fleſh doe rage and raigne, and we on the other ſide through the ſpirite doe wraſtle againſt the ſame, then is there a place for hope. In deede we haue begun to be iuſtified through Faith: whereby alſo we haue receaued the firſt frutes of the ſpirite, and the
<pb facs="tcp:9456:235"/>
the mortification of the fleſh is alſo begun in vs: but we be not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetly righteous. It remaineth then that we be perfectly iuſtified, and this is it that we hope for. So our righteouſnes is not yet in actuall poſſeſſion but lieth vnder hope.</p>
                  <p>This is a ſweete and a ſound conſolation, whereby afflicted and troubled conſciences feeling their ſinne, and terrified with euery fierie dart of the Deuill, may be maruelouſly comforted. For the feeling of ſinne, the wrath of God, death, hell and all other terrours, is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtrong in the conflict of conſcience: as I my ſelfe being taught by experience doe know. Then counſell muſt be geuen to the poore afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this wiſe: Brother thou deſireſt to haue a ſenſible feeling of thy iuſtification: that is, thou wouldeſt haue ſuch a feling of Gods fauour, as thou haſt of thine owne ſinne: but that will not be. But thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes ought to ſurmount all feeling of ſinne: that is to ſay, thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes or iuſtification wherevpon thou holdeſt, ſtandeth not vppon thine owne feeling, but vpon thy hoping that it ſhall be reuealed when it pleaſeth the Lord. Wherefore thou muſt not iudge according to the feeling of ſinne which troubleth and terrifieth thee,<note place="margin">The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of the faithfull ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in feeling.</note> but according to the promiſe and doctrine of Faith, whereby Chriſte is promiſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, who is thy perfect and euerlaſting righteouſnes. Thus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hope of the afflicted conſiſting in the inward affection, is ſtirred vppe by Faith in the middeſt of all terrours and feeling of ſinne, to hope that he is righteous. Moreouer, if hope be here taken for the thing which is hoped for, it is thus to be vnderſtand, that that which a man now ſeeth not, he hopeth in time ſhall be made perfect and clearly reueiled.</p>
                  <p>Either ſenſe may well ſtand: but the firſt touching the inward deſire and affection of hoping, bringeth more plentifull conſolation. For my righteouſnes is not yet perfect, it can not yet be felt: yet I doe not deſpaire: for Faith ſheweth vnto me Chriſte in whom I truſt, and when I haue laid hold of him by Faith, I wraſtle againſt the fierie dartes of the Deuil, and I take a good heart through hope againſt the feeling of ſinne, aſſuring my ſelfe that I haue a perfect righteouſnes prepared for me in heauen. So both theſe ſayings are true, that I am made righteous alredy by that righteouſnes which is begun in me: and alſo I am raiſed vppe in the ſame hope againſt ſinne, and waite for the full conſummation of perfect righteouſnes in heauen. Theſe things are not rightly vnderſtand, but when they be put in practiſe.</p>

                     <head>VVhat difference there is betwene Faith and Hope.</head>
                     <p>Here riſeth a queſtion, what difference there is betwene Faith and Hope. The Sophiſters and Schooleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue laboured very much in this matter, but they could neuer ſhew any certaintie. Yea to vs which trauell in the holy Scriptures with much diligence, and alſo with more fulnes and power of ſpirite (be it ſpoken w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any bragge) it is hard to finde any differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For there is ſo great affinitie betwene Faith and hope, that the one can not be ſeperate from the other. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there is a difference betwene them, which is gathered of their ſeuerall offices, diuerſitie of working, and of their endes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they differ in reſpect of their ſubiect, that is,<note place="margin">Faith &amp; hope differ in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their ſubiect. <hi>Exod. 25.20.</hi>
                        </note> of the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wherin they reſt: For Faith reſteth in the vnderſtanding, and hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the will: but in very deede they can not be ſeperated, the one hauing reſpect to the other, as the two Cherubins of the Mercieſeat, which could not be deuided.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they differ in reſpect of their office, that is,<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betvven faith and hope in their office.</note> of theyr working. For faith telleth what is to be done, it teacheth, preſcribeth, and directeth, and it is a knowledge. Hope is an exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp the minde that it may be ſtrong, bold, and couragious: that it may ſuffer and endure aduerſitie, and in the middeſt thereof wait for better things.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they differ as touching their obiect, that is,<note place="margin">The difference as touching the obiect.</note> the ſpeciall matter whervnto they looke. For Faith hath for her obiect the truth, teaching vs to cleaue ſurely therto, and loketh vpon the word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the thing that is promiſed. Hope hath for her obiect the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, and loketh vpon the thing which is promiſed in the word, that is, vpon ſuch matters as Faith teacheth vs to be hoped for.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, they differ in order:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Difference in order.</hi> Rom. 5.3.4.5.</note> For Faith is the beginning of life before all tribulation. Heb. 11. But hope cometh afterwardes proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of tribulations. Rom. 5.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, they differ by the diuerſitie of working:<note place="margin">Difference in vvorking.</note> For Faith is a teacher and a iudge, fighting againſt errours and hereſies, iudging ſpirites &amp; doctrines. But hope is as it were the Generall or Captaine of the field, fighting againſt tribulation, the croſſe, impatiencie, heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſpirite, weaknes, deſperation and blaſphemie, and it waiteth for good things euen in the middeſt of all euils.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, when I am inſtructed by Faith in the word of God,
<pb facs="tcp:9456:236"/>
and lay holde of Chriſte, beleuing in him with my whole heart, then am I righteous by this knowledge. When I am ſo iuſtified by Faith or by this knowledge, by and by cometh the Deuill the father of lies, and laboureth to extinguiſh my Faith by wiles and ſubtilties: that is to ſay, by lies, errours and hereſies. Moreouer, becauſe he is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, he goeth about alſo to oppreſſe it by violence. Here hope wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, layeth holde on the thinge reuealed by Faithe, and ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Deuill that warreth againſt Faith: and after this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie foloweth peace &amp; ioy in the holy Ghoſt: So that in very deede faith &amp; hope can ſcarſely be diſcerned the one from the other, &amp; yet is there a certaine difference betwene them. And that it may be the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, I will ſet out the matter by a ſimilitude.</p>
                     <p>In ciuill gouernment Prudence and Fortitude doe differ, and yet theſe two vertues are ſo ioyned together, that they can not eaſily be ſeuered. Now, fortitude is a conſtancie of minde, which is not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in aduerſity, but endureth valiantly, &amp; waiteth for better things. But if fortitude be not guided by prudence, it is but temeritie and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betvven faith and hope in diuinitie, is the ſame that is betvvene fortitude and prudence in policie.</note> On the other ſide, if fortitude be not ioyned with prudence, that prudence is but vaine and vnprofitable. Therfore like as in policy pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is but vaine without fortitude: euen ſo in Diuinitie Faith w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out hope is nothing: For hope endureth aduerſity and is conſtant therin, and in the end ouercometh all euils. And on the other ſide, like as forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude without prudence is raſhnes, euen ſo hope without faith is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in ſpirite, and a tempting of God: for it hath no knowledge of Chriſt and of the truth which Faith teacheth, and therfore it is but a blind raſhnes &amp; arrogancie. Wherfore a godly man afore all things, muſt haue a right vnderſtanding inſtructed by Faith, according to the which the minde may be guided in afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that it may hope for thoſe good things which Faith hath reuealed and taught.</p>
                     <p>To be ſhort, Faith is conceaued by teaching: for thereby the minde is inſtructed what the truthe is. Hope is conceaued by exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: for by exhortation hope is ſtirred vppe in afflictions, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth him that is alredy iuſtified by Faith, that he be not ouercome by aduerſities, but that he may be able more ſtrongly to reſiſt them. Notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding if the ſparke of Faith ſhould not geue light to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> will, it could not be perſwaded to lay holde vpon hope.

Wherfore circumciſion, and the obſeruation of the lawe: alſo the workes, religions and vowes of the Monkes and of all ſuch as truſt in their owne righteouſnes, are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether carnall.

                  <p>Againe, this conſolation belongeth to all thoſe that are afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which through tentation conceaue a falſe opinion of Chriſte.<note place="margin">A conſolation for them vvhich con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue a falſe opinion of Chriſte.</note> For the Deuill is a wonderfull craftie perſwader, and knoweth how to amplie the leaſt ſinne, yea a very trifle, in ſuch ſort that he which is tempted ſhall thinke it to be a moſt hainous and horrible crime, and worthie of eternall damnation.

                  <p>But if Satan ouerthrow this (For he is a cunning workman, and will leaue no way vnaſſayed) and lay againſt thee the word and example of Chriſte in this wiſe: True it is that Chriſt is meeke, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and mercifull, but to thoſe which are holy and righteous. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to the ſinners he threatneth wrath and deſtruction. Luke. 13. Alſo he pronounceth that the vnbeleuers are damned already. Iohn. 3. Moreouer, Chriſte wrought many good works: he ſuffered alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny euilles, and commaundeth vs to folow his example. But thy life is neither according to Chriſtes word nor his example: For thou are a ſinner, and there is no Faith in thee: Yea thou haſt done no good at all, and therefore thoſe ſentences which ſet forth Chriſt as a ſeuere iudge, doe belong to thee, and not thoſe comfortable ſentences which ſhew him to be a louing and a mercifull Sauiour, &amp;c.

For the Goſpell ſetteth forth the mercy and glory of God:<note place="margin">The Goſpell ſetteth forth the glory of God, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſeth the craftes of the Deuill.</note> It diſcloſeth the malice and ſleightes of the Deuill, painting him out in his right coulours, and plucking from him the counterfet viſour of Gods Maieſtie, wherby he deceaueth the whole world: that is to ſay, it ſheweth that all worſhippings, religious Orders inuented by men, and traditions concerning ſingle life, meates, and ſuch other things, wherby men thinke to deſerue forgeuenes of ſinnes &amp; euerlaſting life, are wicked things and deueliſh doctrine. There is nothing then that more ſtirreth vppe the Deuill, than the preaching of the Goſpell.

                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:9456:244"/>Here riſeth a queſtion: whether it be lawfull for Chriſtians to curſe? Why not? howbeit not alwayes, nor for euery cauſe.<note place="margin">VVhether it be lavvful for Chriſtians to curſe.</note> But when the matter is come to this poynt, that Gods word muſt be euill ſpoken of and his doctrine blaſphemed, and ſo conſequently God him ſelfe, then muſt we turne this ſentence and ſay: Bleſſed be God and his word, and what ſo euer is without God and his word, accurſed be it: yea though it be an Apoſtle or an Angell from heauen. So he ſayd before in the firſt Chapter:<note place="margin">Galath. 1.3.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Although vve or an Angell from heauen preach othervviſe vnto you, then that vvhich vve haue preached, let him be accurſed.</hi>

Let not vs therefore make litle account of the leauen of doctrine: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be neuer ſo litle, yet if it be neglected, it will be the cauſe that by litle and litle the truth and our ſaluation ſhall be loſt, and God himſelfe be denied. For when the word is corrupted, and God denied and blaſphemed (which muſt needes folow if the word be corrupted) there remaineth no hope of ſaluation. But for our partes, if we be curſed, railed vppon and ſlaine, there is yet one that can raiſe vs vppe againe, and deliuer vs from the curſe, death and hell.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore lette vs learne to aduaunce and extoll the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie &amp; authoritie of Gods word.<note place="margin">The Maieſtie of Gods vvord is highly to be aduaunced.</note> For it is no ſmall trifle (as brainſicke heades ſurmiſe at this day): but euery title thereof is greater then heauen and earth. Wherefore in this reſpect we haue no regard of Chriſtian charitie or concord, but we ſitte as it were on the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat, that is to ſay: we curſe and condemne all men, which in the leaſt poynt deface or corrupt the Maieſtie of Gods word: <hi>For a litle leauen maketh ſovver the vvhole lumpe.</hi> But if they leaue vs Gods word entire and ſound, we are not onely ready to keepe charitie and peace with them: but alſo we offer our ſelues to be their ſeruauntes, and to doe for them what ſo euer we are able: If not, lette them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and be caſt downe into hell: and not onely they, but euen the whole world alſo: ſo that God and his pure word doe remaine.

All boaſt themſelues to be profeſſors of the Goſpell, and all bragge of Chriſtian libertie: and yet ſeruing their owne luſtes, they geue themſelues to couetouſnes, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, pride, enuie, and ſuch other vices. No man doth his duetie faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charitably ſerueth the neceſſity of his brother.

                  <p>Moreouer, euen we which teach the word, doe not now our due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with ſo great zeale and diligence in the light of the Goſpell, as we did afore in the darknes of ignoraunce. For the more certaine we be of the freedome purchaſed vnto vs by Chriſt, ſo much the more cold and negligent we be in handling the word, in prayer, in well doing, and in ſuffering aduerſites.<note place="margin">The profite of tentations.</note> And if Sathan did not vexe vs inwardly with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall tentations, and outwardly with the perſecutions of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and moreouer with the contempt and ingratitude of our owne fellowes, we ſhould become vtterly careles, negligent, and vntoward to all good workes: and ſo in time we ſhould loſe the knowledge and Faith of Chriſt forſake the miniſterie of the word, and ſeeke an eaſier kinde of life for the fleſh. Which thing many of our men begin to doe, for that they trauailing in the miniſterie of the word, can not onely not liue of their labour, but alſo are moſt miſerably entreated euen of thoſe by whom they were deliuered from the ſeruile bondage of the Pope by the preaching of the Goſpell. Theſe men forſaking poore and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:9456:246"/>
offenſiue Chriſt, entangle them ſelues with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affaires of this preſent life, ſeruing their owne bellies and not Chriſte: but with what fruite, that ſhall they finde by experience in time to come.</p>
                  <p>For as much then as we know that the Deuill layeth waite moſt of all for vs that haue the world (for the reſt he holdeth in captiuitie and ſlauerie at his pleaſure) and laboureth with might and maine to take from vs the libertie of the ſpirite, or at leaſt wiſe to turne the ſame into the libertie of the fleſh: we teach and exhort our brethern with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler care and diligence by the example of <hi>Paule,</hi> that they thinke not this libertie of the ſpirite purchaſed by the death of Chriſt, to be geuen vnto them, that they ſhould make it an occaſion of carnall libertie, or (as Peter ſayeth) ſhould vſe the ſame as a cloke for their wickednes:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.16.</note> but that they ſhould ſerue one an other through loue.</p>
                  <p>To the ende therfore that Chriſtians ſhould not abuſe this libertie (as I haue ſayd) the Apoſtle layeth a yoke and bondage vppon their fleſh by the lawe of mutuall loue.<note place="margin">The godly are free accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the ſpirite, but bond ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the flesh.</note> Wherefore let the godly remember that in conſcience before God, they be free from the curſe of the lawe, from ſinne and from death, for Chriſtes ſake: but as touching the body they are ſeruauntes and muſt ſerue one an other through charitie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this commaundement of <hi>Paule.</hi> Let euery man therfore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to doe his duetie diligently in his calling, &amp; to helpe his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to the vttermoſt of his power. This is it which <hi>Paule</hi> here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of vs: <hi>Serue ye one an other through loue.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> Which words doe not ſet the Chriſtians at libertie, but ſhut them vnder bondage as touching the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer this doctrine concerning mutuall loue which we muſt maintaine and exerciſe one towardes an other, can not be beaten into the heades of carnall men, nor ſinke into their heartes. The Chriſtians doe gladly receaue and obey this doctrine. Others as ſoone as liberty is preached, by and by doe thus inferre: If I be free,<note place="margin">Carnall men abuſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an libertie.</note> then may I doe what I liſt: This thing is mine owne, why then ſhould I not ſell it for as much as I may gette? Moreouer, ſeeing we obtaine not ſaluation by our good works, why ſhould we geue any thing to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> poore? Thus doe they moſt careleſly ſhake of the yoke and bondage of the fleſh, and turne the libertie of the ſpirite into wantonnes and ſleſhly libertie. But we tell ſuch careleſſe contemners (although they beleue vs not, but laugh vs to ſcorne), that if they vſe their bodies and their goodes after their owne luſt (as in deede they doe, for they neither helpe the poore, nor lend to the needie, but beguile their brethern in bargaining, ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

&amp; ſcraping vnto themſelues by hooke or by crooke what ſo euer they can gette), we tell them (I ſay) that they be not free, bragge they neuer ſo much of their libertie, but haue loſt Chriſte and Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, are become the bondſlaues of the Deuill, and are ſeuen times worſer vnder the name of Chriſtian libertie, then they were before vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tyrannie of the Pope. For the Deuill which was driuen out of them, hath taken vnto him ſeuen other feends worſe then him ſelfe, and is returned into them againe: therefore the ende of theſe men is worſe then the beginning.</p>
                  <p>As touching vs, we haue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God to preach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel, which offereth to all men libertie from the law, ſinne, death and Gods wrath, frely for Chriſtes ſake, if they beleue.

                  <p>Now, in geuing preceptes of loue, he couertly toucheth by the way the falſe teachers: againſt whom he ſetteth him ſelfe mightely, that he may defend and ſtabliſh his doctrine of good workes againſt them. As if he ſayd: O ye Galathians, I haue hetherto taught you the true and ſpirituall life, and now alſo I will teach you what be good workes in deede. And this will I doe to the ende ye may know that the vaine and fooliſh workes of ceremonies which the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles doe onely vrge, are farre inferiour to the workes of charitie.

                  <p>The Apoſtle therfore diligently exhorteth the Chriſtians to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelues in good workes, after that they haue heard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the pure doctrine of Faith. For the remnauntes of ſinne doe yet ſtill remaine euen in thoſe that be iuſtified: which, as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Faith and hinder it: ſo doe they hinder vs from doing good workes.<note place="margin">Reaſon is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vvith ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</note> Moreouer, mans reaſon and the fleſh, which in the ſainctes them ſelues reſiſteth the ſpirite, and in the wicked doth mightely raigne, is naturally delited with Phariſaicall ſuperſtitions: that is to ſay, it taketh more pleaſure in meaſuring God by her owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, than by his word, and doth the works that ſhe her ſelfe hath choſen, with farre greater zeale then thoſe which God hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Wherfore it is neceſſary that the godly preachers ſhould as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently teach and vrge the doctrine of good workes, as the doctrine of Faith: for Satan is a deadly enemie to both. Notwithſtanding faith muſt firſt be planted: for without Faith it is impoſſible to vnderſtand what a good worke is, or what pleaſeth God.</p>
                  <p>Let no man thinke therefore that he thorowly knoweth this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement: <hi>Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> In deede it is very ſhort and eaſy as touching the wordes:<note place="margin">No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loueth his neighbour as himſelfe.</note> but ſhew me the teachers and hearers that in teaching, learning, and liuing doe exerciſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it rightly. Therefore theſe wordes: <hi>Serue ye one an other through loue:</hi> and theſe alſo, <hi>Thou shalt loue thy neighbor as thy ſelf,</hi> are incomprehenſible, &amp; no man, no not euen the godly doe ſufficiently conſider, teach, and exerciſe the ſame. And (which is a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful thing) the faithfull haue this tentation, that if they omit neuer ſo light a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they ought to do, by and by their conſcience is wounded: but they are not ſo troubled if they neglect the dueties of charitie (as daily they doe),<note place="margin">Naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption &amp; ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the faithfull.</note> or beare not a ſincere and brotherly loue and affection towards their neighbour. For they doe not ſo much regard the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of charitie, as their owne ſuperſtitions: from the which they be not altogether free during this life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> therfore reprehendeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Galathians in theſe words: <hi>For the vvhole lavv is fulfilled in one vvord.</hi> As if he had ſaid: ye are drowned in your ſuperſtitions &amp; ceremonies concerning places &amp; times, which
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:9456:248"/>
profit neither your ſelues nor others: and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane while ye neglect charitie which ye ought onely to haue kept. What madnes is this? So ſayth <hi>Ierome:</hi> We weare &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume our bodies with watching,<note place="margin">A ſaying of Hierome.</note> faſting and labour: but we neglect charitie, which is the onely lady &amp; miſtreſſe of workes. And this may be wel ſeene in the Monkes, who ſtraitly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their traditions concerning their ceremonies, faſting, watching, apparel &amp; ſuch like.

                     <hi>Beleue in Chriſt.</hi> And againe: <hi>Loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> Therefore it deſpiſeth both the doctrine of Faith and true good works.

But, beleue me, they are ſuch workes, that the whole world is not able to comprehend the excellencie and worthines thereof (for it doth not meaſure workes or any other thing by the word of God, but by the iudgement of wicked, blinde and fooliſh reaſon): Yea it knoweth not the valew of any one of the leaſt good works y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can be, which are true good works in deede.</p>

                  <p>Of this commaundement I haue largely entreated in an other place, and therfore I will now but lightly ouerrunne it.<note place="margin">A briefe expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi>
                     </note> In deede this is briefly ſpoken: <hi>Loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe,</hi> but yet very aptly and to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> purpoſe. No man can geue a more certaine, a better or a nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer example then a mans owne ſelfe. Therfore, if thou wouldeſt know how thy neighbour ought to be loued,<note place="margin">Hovv our neighbour ought to be loued.</note> and wouldeſt haue a plaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample therof, conſider well how thou loueſt thy ſelfe. If thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be in neceſſitie or daunger thou wouldeſt be glad to haue the loue and frendſhip of all men, to be holpen with the counſell, the goods and the ſtrength of all men &amp; of all creatures. Wherfore thou haſt no neede of any booke to inſtruct and to admoniſh thee how thou oughteſt to loue thy neighbour: for thou haſt an excellent booke of all lawes euen in thy heart. Thou needeſt no Scholemaſter in this matter: aſke coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell onely of thine owne heart, and that ſhall teach thee ſufficiently that thou oughteſt to loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. Moreouer,<note place="margin">Charitie a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vertue.</note> loue or charitie is an excellent vertue, which not onely maketh a man willing and ready to ſerue his neighbour with tounge, with hand, with money and worldly goods: but with his body, and euen with his life alſo. And thus to doe, it is not prouoked by good deſertes or any thing elſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it hindred through euill deſertes or ingratitude. The mother doth therefore nouriſh and cheriſh her child, becauſe ſhe loueth it.</p>
                  <p>Now, my neighbour is euery man,<note place="margin">VVho is our neighbour.</note> ſpecially which hath neede of my helpe, as Chriſt expoundeth it in the .10. chapt. of <hi>Luke.</hi> Who although he hath done me ſome wrong, or hurt me by any maner of way: yet notwithſtanding he hath not put of the nature of man, or cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be fleſh and bloud, &amp; the creature of God moſt like vnto my ſelfe:
<pb facs="tcp:9456:250"/>
briefly, he ceaſeth not to be my neighbour. As long then as the nature of man remaineth in him,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of charitie.</note> ſo long alſo remaineth the commaundement of loue, which requireth at my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that I ſhould not deſpiſe mine own fleſh, nor render euill for euill, but ouercome euill with good: or elſe ſhall loue neuer be as <hi>Paule</hi> deſcribeth it .1.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> therefore commendeth charitie to the Galathians, and to all the faithfull (for they onely loue in deede), and exhorteth them that through charitie one of them ſhould ſerue an other.

                  <p>By theſe wordes <hi>Paule</hi> witneſſeth that if the foundation, that is to ſay, if Faith in Chriſt be ouerthrowne by wicked teachers, no peace or concord ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remaine in the church either in doctrine or life: but there muſt needes be diuers opinions and diſſenſions from time to time both in doctrine and life, wherby it commeth to paſſe that one biteth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth an other, that is to ſay, one iudgeth and condemneth an other, vntill at length they be conſumed. Hereof not onely the Scripture, but alſo the examples of all times beare witnes. After that Aphrike was peruerted by the Manichees, by and by folowed the Donatiſtes, who alſo diſagreeing among them ſelues, were diuided into three ſundry Sectes. And how many Sectes haue we at this day ſpringing vppe one after an other? One Sect bringeth forth an other, and one condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth an other. Thus, when the vnitie of the ſpirite is broken, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that there ſhould be any concord either in doctrine or life, but daily new errours muſt nedes ſpring vp w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out meaſure and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paule</hi> therefore teacheth that ſuch occaſions of diſcord are to be auoided, and he ſheweth how they may be auoided. This (ſayth he) is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way to vnitie and concord: Let euery man doe his duetie in that kinde
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:9456:250"/>
of life which God hath called him vnto: Let him not lift vp himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue others, nor finde fault at other mens workes,<note place="margin">The vvay hovv to kepe concord.</note> and commend his owne, but let euery one ſerue an other through loue. This is a true and a ſimple doctrine touching good works. This do not they teach which haue made ſhipwracke of faith &amp; haue conceaued fantaſticall opinions concerning Faith &amp; good workes: but diſagreeing among them ſelues as touching the doctrine of Faith and workes, they bite and deuoure, that is to ſay, they accuſe &amp; condemne one an other, as <hi>Paule</hi> here ſayth of the Galathians. <hi>If ye bite and deuoure one an other, take heede leſt ye be conſumed one of an other.</hi> As if he would ſay: doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and condemne one an other for circumciſion, for obſeruing of holy dayes or other ceremonies, but rather geue your ſelues to ſerue and helpe one an other through charitie: Or elſe if ye continue in biting &amp; deuouring one an other, take heede that ye be not conſumed, that is to ſay, that ye periſh not vtterly, yea and that bodely, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, eſpecially to the authors of Sects, as it did to Arrius &amp; others,<note place="margin">The ende of the authors of vvicked opinions.</note> and to certaine alſo in our time. For he that hath laid his fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation on the ſand, and buildeth hay, ſtubble and ſuch like, muſt needes fall &amp; be conſumed: for all thoſe things are ordained for the fire. I will not ſay that after ſuch bitings &amp; deuourings, the ruine &amp; deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not of one citie, but of whole countreys &amp; kingdoms are wont to folow. Now the Apoſtle ſheweth what it is to ſerue one an other through loue.</p>
                  <p>It is a hard &amp; a dangerous matter to teach that we are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by faith without works, &amp; yet to require workes withall. Here, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the miniſters of Chriſte be faithfull &amp; wiſe diſpoſers of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, rightly diuiding the word of truth: faith &amp; workes are by and by confounded. Both theſe doctrines, as well of faith as of works, muſt be dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly taught and vrged: and yet ſo, that both may remaine w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in their bounds.

                  <p>The Apoſtle began a litle before, to exhort men to good workes, and to teach that the whole lawe was fulfilled in one word, namely: <hi>Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> Here will ſome man ſay:<note place="margin">An obiection.</note> 
                     <hi>Paule</hi> thorowout his whole Epiſtle taketh away righteouſnes from the law: for ſayeth he, <hi>By the vvorks of the lavv shall no flesh be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi> Alſo, <hi>As many as are vnder the vvorks of the lavv,</hi>

in all this Epiſtle, and to be of a quite contrary opinion: to witte, that they which doe the works of charitie, fulfill the law and be righteous. To this obiection he anſwereth after this maner.</p>

                  <p>Although <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh here expreſly and plainly enough, yet hath he litle preuailed.

                  <p>True it is that we ought to fulfill the lawe, and to be iuſtified through the fulfilling thereof: but ſinne hindreth vs. In deede the law preſcribeth and commaundeth that we ſhould loue God with all our heart,<note place="margin">So euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: It is vvrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is done</note> &amp;c. and that we ſhould loue our neighbour as our ſelues, but it foloweth not: this is wrytten, therfore it is done: the law commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth loue, therefore we loue.

Yea euen at the firſt brunt he can not refraine him ſelfe, but is angrie with his neighbour, deſireth to be reuenged, and hateth him as an enemie, or at the leaſt loueth him not ſo much as he ſhould doe, and as this commaundement requireth. And this hapneth euen to the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Apoſtle hath geuen this rule for the faithfull, that they ſhould ſerue one an other through loue, that they ſhould beare the burdens and infirmities one of an other, and that they ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue one an other. And without this bearing and forbearing through loue, it is impoſſible that peace and concord ſhould continue amongſt Chriſtians. For it can not be, but that thou muſt needes often offend, and be offended. Thou ſeeſt many things in me which offend thee, and I againe ſee many things in thee which miſlike me. Here, if one beare not with an other through loue, there ſhall be no end of diſſenſion, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, enuie, hatred and malice.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore <hi>Paul</hi> would haue vs to walke in the ſpirit,<note place="margin">To vvalke in the ſpirite.</note> leſt we fulfil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> luſt of the fleſh. As if he ſhould ſay: Although ye be moued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wrath &amp; diſpleaſure againſt your brother, offending you or doing any thing hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt you, yet notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding reſiſt &amp; repreſſe theſe viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s through the ſpirit. Beare with his weaknes and loue him according to that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement: <hi>Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi> For thy brother doth not therfore ceaſe to be thy neighbour, becauſe he ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth or offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth thee: but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath he moſt nede y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ſhuldeſt exerciſe
<pb facs="tcp:9456:253"/>
and ſhew thy charitie towardes him. And this commaundement: <hi>Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe,</hi> requireth the ſelfe ſame thing: to wit, that thou ſhouldeſt not obey y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fleſh: which when it is offended, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, biteth and deuoureth. But wraſte againſt it in ſpirit, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue through the ſame in the loue of thy neighbour, although thou finde no thing in him worthy of loue.</p>
                  <p>The Scholemen take the concupiſcence of the fleſh for carnall luſt. In deede it is true that euen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> godly, eſpecially y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger ſort are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with fleſhly luſt. Yea, they alſo that be married (ſo corrupt and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent is fleſh) are not without ſuch carnall luſt. Here let euery one (I ſpeake now to the godly beinge married,<note place="margin">VVhat the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcence or luſt of the flesh is after Paule.</note> bothe man and wife) dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examine him ſelfe, and, no doubt, many ſhall finde this in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that the bewtie and conditions of an other mans wife pleaſeth him better then of his owne: &amp; ſo contrariwiſe. His owne lawfull wife he lotheth or miſliketh &amp; loueth her which is vnlawful. And this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is wont to happen, not in marriage onely, but in all other matters. Men ſet light by that which they haue, &amp; are in loue with that which they haue not: as the Poet ſaith:

                              </expan> negata:</hi> That is,</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I doe not deny therfore but that the concupiſcence of the fleſh compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth carnall luſt, but not that onely For concupiſcence comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all other corrupt affections, wherewith the very faithful are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, ſome more, ſome leſſe: as pride, hatred, couetouſnes, impatiency and ſuch like. Yea <hi>Paule</hi> rehearſeth afterwardes among the works of the fleſh, not only theſe groſſe vices, but alſo idolatry, hereſies and ſuch other. It is plaine therfore that he ſpeaketh of the whole concupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the fleſh &amp; of the whole dominion of ſinne, which ſtriueth eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the godly who haue receaued the firſt fruites of the ſpirite, againſt the dominion of the ſpirite. He ſpeaketh therefore not onely of carnall luſt, pride, couetouſnes. &amp;c: but alſo of incredulitie, diſtruſt, deſpaire, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, &amp; contempt of God, idolatrie, hereſies and ſuch other, when he ſayth: <hi>And ye shall not fulfill the luſts of the flesh.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay: I wryte vnto you that ye ſhould loue one an other. This ye do not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can ye doe it becauſe of the fleſh, which is infected and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with concupiſcence, and doth not onely ſtirre vppe ſinne in you, but alſo is ſinne it ſelf. For if ye had perfect charitie, no heauines, no aduerſitie could be ſo great, which ſhould be able to hurt or hinder
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:9456:253"/>
that charitie: for it would be ſpread throughout the whole body. There ſhould be no wife, were ſhe neuer ſo hard fauoured, whom her huſband would not loue entirely, lothing all other wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo faire and beautifull. But this is not done: therefore it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs to be made righteous through loue.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, thinke me not to reuoke and vnſay that which I haue taught concerning Faith: For Faith and hope muſt continue, that by the one we may be iuſtified, and by the other we may be raiſed vppe in aduerſities, and endure vnto the ende. Moreouer, we ſerue one an other through charitie, becauſe Faith is not idle: but charitie is weake and litle. Therefore when I bid you walke in the ſpirite, I doe ſufficiently declare that ye are not iuſtified through charitie.</p>
                  <p>And when I exhort you to walke in the ſpirite, that ye fulfill not the concupiſcence of the fleſh: I doe not require of you that ye ſhould vtterly put of the fleſh or kill it, but that ye ſhould bridle and ſubdue it. For God will haue mankinde to indure euen to the laſt day. And this can not be done without parentes, which doe begette and bring vppe children. Theſe meanes continuing, it muſt needes be that fleſh alſo muſt continue, and conſequently ſinne, for fleſh is not without ſinne. Therefore in reſpect of the fleſh we are ſinners: but in reſpect of the ſpirite, we are righteous: and ſo we are partly ſinners, and partly righteous. Notwithſtanding,<note place="margin">Beleuers are both ſinners &amp; righteous.</note> our righteouſnes is much more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull then our ſinne, becauſe the holines and righteouſnes of Chriſte our Mediatour doth farre excede the ſinne of the whole world: And the forgeuenes of ſinnes which we haue through him is ſo great, ſo large, and ſo infinite, that it eaſily ſwaloweth vp all ſinnes, ſo that we walke according to the ſpirite. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſtes dreamed that this commaundement belongeth only to their Cleargymen, and that the Apoſtle exhorteth them to liue chaſtly by ſubduing the fleſh w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> watching, faſting, labour. &amp;c: and then they ſhould not fulfill the concupiſcence of the fleſh, that is to ſay, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall luſt. As though the whole concupiſcence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh were ouercome when this fleſhly luſt is ſubdued: which notwithſtanding they were neuer able to ſuppreſſe and keepe vnder with any yoke that they could lay vppon the fleſh.<note place="margin">Hierome.</note> Which thing <hi>Hierome</hi> (I ſay nothing of others) who was a maruelous louer and defender of chaſtitie, doth plainly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. O (ſaith he) how often haue I thought my ſelfe to be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middeſt of the vaine delites and pleaſures of Rome, euen when I was in the wilde wildernes, which being burnt vppe with the heat of the Sunne,
<pb facs="tcp:9456:254"/>
yeldeth an ougleſome habitation to the Monks? &amp;c. Againe: I, who for feare of hell had condemned my ſelfe to ſuch a priſon, thought my ſelfe ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times to be dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing among yong wemen, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had no other companie but Scorpions and wilde beaſtes. My face was pale with faſting, but my minde was inflamed with deſires in my cold body, and although my fleſh was halfe dead already, yet the flames of fleſhly luſt boyled within me. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Hierome</hi> felt in him ſelfe ſuch flames of fleſhly luſt, who liued in the barraine wildernes with bread and water:<note place="margin">The veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t flames of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall luſt in Hierome.</note> what do our holy bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygods the Cleargiemen feele (thinke ye): who ſo ſtuffe and ſtretch out them ſelues with all kindes of daintie fare, that it is maruell theyr bellies burſt not? Wherfore theſe things are wrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to Heremites &amp; Monks (as the Papiſts dreame) nor to ſinners in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world onely: but to the vniuerſall church of Chriſt, and to all the faithfull: whom <hi>Paule</hi> exhorteth to walke in the ſpirite, that they fulfill not the luſts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh: that is to ſay, not onely to bridle the groſſe motions of the fleſh, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall luſt, wrath, impatiencie, &amp; ſuch like: but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirituall motions, as douting, blaſphemie, idolatrie, contempt and hatred of God, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>

Therefore when a man fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth this battell of the fleſh, lette him not be diſcouraged therewith, but let him reſiſt in ſpirite, and ſay: I am a ſinner, and I feele ſinne in me: for I haue not yet put of the fleſh, in which ſinne dwelleth ſo long as it liueth.

                  <p>It is very profitable for the godly to know this, and to beare it wel in minde: for it wonderfully comforteth them when they are tempted. When I was a Monke I thought by and by that I was vtterly caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if at any time I felt the luſt of the fleſh: that is to ſay, if I felt any euill motion, fleſhly luſt, wrath, hatred or enuie againſt any brother.

                  <p>But here may ſome man ſay: that it is a daungerous matter to teach that a man is not condemned, if by and by he ouercome not the motions and paſſions of the fleſh which he feeleth.

                  <p>This battell of the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, all the children of God haue had and felt: And the ſelfe ſame doe we alſo feele and proue. He that ſearcheth his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, if he be not an hypocrite, ſhall well perceaue that to be true in him ſelfe which <hi>Paule</hi> here ſaith: that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit.<note place="margin">The children of God do fele the rebellion of the flesh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</note> All the faithfull therfore do feele and confeſſe that their fleſh reſiſteth againſt the ſpirit, and that theſe two are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye the one to the other in themſelues, that, doe what they can, they are not able to performe that which they woulde doe. Therefore the fleſhe hindreth vs the we cannot keepe the commaundementes of God, that we can not loue our neighbours as our ſelues, much leſſe can we loue God with all our heart: Therefore it is impoſſible for vs to become righteous by the works of the law. In deede there is a good will in vs, and ſo muſt there be (for it is the ſpirit it ſelf which reſiſteth the fleſh), which would gladly doe good, fulfill the lawe, loue God and his neighbour, and ſuch like, but the fleſh obeyeth not this good will, but reſiſteth it: and yet God imputeth not vnto vs this ſinne: For he is mercifull to thoſe that beleue for Chriſtes ſake.</p>
                  <p>But it foloweth not therefore that thou ſhouldeſt make a light matter of ſinne becauſe God doth not impute it. True it is that he doth not impute it.<note place="margin">To vvhom God doth not impute ſinne.</note> But to whom, and for what cauſe? To ſuch as repent, and lay hold by Faith vppon Chriſte the Mercyſeat, for whoſe ſake, as all their ſinnes are forgeuen them: euen ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> remnants of ſinne which are in them, be not imputed vnto them. They make not their ſinne leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is, but amplifie it &amp; ſet it out as it is in dede: for they know that it can not be put away by ſatiſfactions, works or righteouſnes, but only by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Chriſte. And yet notwithſtanding the greatnes and enormitie of their ſinne doth not cauſe them to deſpaire, but they aſſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues that the ſame ſhall not be imputed vnto them or laid vnto their charge.</p>
                  <p>This I ſay leſt any man ſhoulde thinke that after faith is receaued, there is litle accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be made of ſinne.

And God alwayes hateth ſinne: yea all ſinne is damnable as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge the facte it ſelfe. But in that it is not damnable to him that beleueth, it commeth of Chriſte, who by his death hath taken away ſinne. But to him that beleueth not in Chriſte, not onely all his ſinnes
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:9456:257"/>

He that beleueth hath as great ſinne as the vnbeleuer. But to him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth, it is forgeuen and not imputed. To the vnbeleuer it is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but imputed.

For the faithfull aſſureth him ſelfe by Faith that his ſinne is forgeuen him, for as much as Chriſte hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him ſelfe for it. Therfore although he haue ſinne in him and daily ſinneth, yet he continueth godly: but contrariwiſe the vnbeleuer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth wicked.<note place="margin">The vviſedom of the godly.</note> And this is the true wiſedome and conſolation of the godly, that although they haue and commit ſinnes, yet they know that for Chriſtes ſake they are not imputed vnto them.</p>
                  <p>This I ſay for the comfort of the godly.<note place="margin">The godly on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly feele ſinne.</note> For they onely feele in deede that they haue and doe commit ſinnes, that is to ſay, they feele that they doe not loue God ſo feruently as they ſhould doe: that they doe not beleue him ſo hartely as they would, but rather they ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times dout whether God haue a care of them or no: they are impatient, and are angrie with God in aduerſitie.

And what is this elſe, but to be vnder the law? But, ſayth he: Let this nothing trouble you:<note place="margin">To be led by the ſpirite.</note> onely doe your endeuour that ye may be led by the ſpirite, that is to ſay: ſhew your ſelues willing to folow &amp; obey that will which reſiſteth the fleſh, and doth not accompliſh the luſtes
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:9456:258"/>
thereof (for this is to be led and to be drawne by the ſpirite): then are ye not vnder the lawe. So <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelfe. Rom. 7. <hi>In my minde I ſerue the lavve of God,</hi> that is to ſay: In ſpirit I am not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to any ſinne: but yet in my fleſh I ſerue the law of ſinne. The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then are not vnder the lawe, that is to ſay, in ſpirite: for the law can not accuſe them, nor pronounce ſentence of death againſt them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they feele ſinne, and confeſſe them ſelues to be ſinners: For the power and ſtrength of the lawe is taken from it by Chriſt:<note place="margin">Galath. 4.4.</note> 
                     <hi>vvho vvas made ſubiect to the lavve, that he might redeme them vvhich vvere vnder the lavve.</hi> Therefore the lawe cannot accuſe that for ſinne in the faithfull, which is ſinne in deede and committed againſt the lawe.</p>
                  <p>So great then is the power and dominion of the ſpirite, that the lawe cannot accuſe the godly, though they commit that which is ſinne in deede. For Chriſte is our righteouſnes, whom we apprehend by Faith: he is without all ſinne, and therfore the law can not accuſe him. As long as we cleaue faſt vnto him, we are ledde by the ſpirite, and are free from the lawe. And ſo the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">VVhat it is to be led by the ſpirite.</note> euen when he teacheth good workes, forgetteth not his doctrine concerning Iuſtification: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſheweth that it is impoſſible for vs to be iuſtified by workes. For the remnants of ſinne cleaue faſt in our fleſh, and therefore ſo long as our fleſh liueth, it ceaſeth not to luſt contrary to the ſpirite. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there cometh no daunger vnto vs thereby, becauſe we be free from the law, ſo that we walke in the ſpirite.</p>
                  <p>And with theſe wordes: <hi>If ye be ledde by the ſpirite, ye be not vnder the lavve,</hi> thou maiſt greatly comfort thy ſelfe and others that be greeuouſly tempted. For it oftentimes commeth to paſſe, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſo vehemently aſſailed with wrath, hatred, impatiencie, carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, terrour and anguiſh of ſpirite, or ſome other luſt of the fleſh, that he can not ſhake them of, though he would neuer ſo faine. What ſhould he doe in this caſe? Should he deſpaire? No, God forbid: but let him ſay thus with him ſelfe: Thy fleſh fighteth and rageth againſt the ſpirite. Let it rage as long as it liſteth: onely ſee thou,<note place="margin">Hovv a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled minde is to be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> that in any caſe thou conſent not to it, to fulfill the luſts therof, but walke wiſely &amp; folow the leading of the ſpirit. In ſo doing thou art free from the law. It accuſeth and terrifieth thee (I graunt), but altogether in vaine. In this conflict therfore of the fleſh againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit, there is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to haue the word of God before thine eyes, and therin to ſeeke the comfort of the ſpirite.</p>
                  <p>And let not him which ſuffereth this temptation be diſmayed, in
<pb facs="tcp:9456:259"/>
that the Deuil can ſo aggrauate ſinne, that during the conflict, he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him ſelfe to be vtterly ouerthrowne, and feeleth nothing elſe but the wrath of God and deſperation. Here in any wiſe let him not folow his owne feeling and the iudgement of reaſon, but lette him take ſure hold of this ſaying of Paule: <hi>If ye be led by the ſpirite,</hi> that is to wit, if ye raiſe vp and comfort your ſelues through faith in Chriſt, ye be not vnder the lawe. So ſhall he haue a ſtrong buckler wherewith he may beat backe all the fierie dartes which that wicked feende aſſaileth him withall. How much ſo euer then the fleſh doe boyle and rage, yet can not all her motions and rages hurt &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne him, for as much as he, folowing the guiding of the ſpirite, doth not conſent vnto the fleſh, nor fulfill the luſtes thereof.<note place="margin">Novv the luſts of the flesh muſt be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</note> Therefore when the motions of the fleſh doe rage, the onely remedie is to take to vs the ſword of the ſpirite, that is to ſay, the word of ſaluation (which is, that God would not the death of a ſinner, but that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert &amp; liue) and to fight againſt them: Which if we doe, let vs not doubt but we ſhall obtaine the victorie, although ſo long as the battaile endureth, we feele the plaine contrary. But ſet the word out of ſight, and there is no counſell nor helpe remaining. Of this that I ſay,<note place="margin">The great and vehement ten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> I my ſelfe haue good experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

But ſo ſoone as I laid hold of any place of Scripture, and ſtayed my ſelfe vppon it as vppon my cheefe ankerhold, ſtraight wayes my tentations did vaniſh away: which without the word it had bene vnpoſſible for me to endure any litle ſpace, and much leſſe to ouercome them.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme or effect therfore of all that which <hi>Paule</hi> hath taught in this diſputation or diſcourſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conflict or battell betwene the fleſh and the ſpirite, is this, that the Sainctes and the elect of God can not performe that which the ſpirit deſireth. For the ſpirite would gladly be altogether pure, but the fleſh being ioyned vnto the ſpirite, will not ſuffer that. Notwithſtanding they be ſaued by the remiſſion of ſinnes, which is in Chriſt Ieſus. Moreouer, becauſe they walke in the ſpirite and are led by the ſpirite,<note place="margin">Not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lavve.</note> they be not vnder the lawe, that is to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not accuſe or terrifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yea although it goe about neuer ſo much ſo to doe, yet ſhal it neuer be able to driue them to deſperation.</p>

But although theſe ſinnes were great and hainous, yet were they not committed vppon any contempt of God or of a wilfull and obſtinate mind, but through infirmitie &amp; weaknes. Againe, when they were admoniſhed, they did not obſtinately continue in their ſinnes, but repented. Such he willeth afterwardes in the .6.

                     <p>When I was a Monke I did oftentimes moſt hartely wiſh, that I might once be ſo happy, as to ſee the conuerſation and life of ſome Sainct or holy man. But in the meane time I imagined ſuch a Sainct as liued in the wildernes abſtaining from meat and drinke, and liuing onely with rootes of herbes and colde water: and this opinion of thoſe monſtrous ſainctes, I had learned not onely out of the bookes of the Sophiſters and Scholemen, but alſo out of the bookes of the fathers. For thus wryteth <hi>Hierome</hi> in a certaine place. As touching meates and drinkes I ſay nothing, for as much as it is exceſſe, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch as are weake and feeble ſhould vſe cold water, or eate any ſodden thing, &amp;c. But now in the light of the Goſpel we plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee who they are whom Chriſt and his Apoſtles call Saincts:<note place="margin">VVho they be vvhich Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles cal ſai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cts.</note> Not they which liue a ſole &amp; a ſingle life, or ſtraitly obſerue dayes, meates, apparel &amp; ſuch other things, or in outward appearance do other great &amp; monſtrous works, (as we read of many in the liues of the fathers):
<pb facs="tcp:9456:261"/>
but they which being called by the ſound of the Goſpell and baptiſed, doe beleue that they be iuſtified and clenſed by the death of Chriſt. So <hi>Paule</hi> euery where, wryting to Chriſtians, calleth them holy, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and heires of God, &amp;c. Who ſo euer then doe beleue in Chriſte, whether they be men or women,<note place="margin">VVho be true Sainctes.</note> bond or free, are all Sainctes: not by their owne workes, but by the workes of God, which they receiue by Faith: as his word, his Sacraments, the paſſion of Chriſt, his death, reſurrection, victorie, and the ſending of the holy Ghoſt. To conclude, they are Sainctes through ſuch a holines as they freely receaue, not through ſuch a holines as they them ſelues haue gotten by their owne induſtrie, good workes and merites.</p>
                     <p>So the miniſters of the worde, the Magiſtrates of common weales, parents, children, maiſters, ſeruauntes, &amp;c. are true Saincts, if firſt and before all things they aſſure themſelues that Chriſt is their wiſedom, righteouſnes, ſanctification and redemption: Secondly, if euery one doe his duetie in his vocation according to the rule of Gods word, and obey not the fleſh, but repreſſe the luſtes and deſires thereof by the ſpirite. Now, where as all be not of like ſtrength to reſiſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but many infirmities and offences are ſeene in the moſt part of men: this nothing hindereth their holines, ſo that their ſinnes procede not of an obſtinate wilfulnes, but onely of frailtie and infirmitie. For (as I haue ſayd before) the godly doe feele the deſires and luſts of the fleſh, but they reſiſt them, to the ende that they accompliſh them not. Alſo if they at any time vnaduiſedly fall into ſinne, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they obtaine forgeuenes thereof, if by Faith in Chriſte they be raiſed vppe againe: who would not that we ſhould driue away, but ſeeke out and bring whom the ſtraying and loſt ſheepe,<note place="margin">The vveaknes of Faith.</note> &amp;c. Therfore God forbid that I ſhould ſtraighte way iudge thoſe which are weake in Faith and maners, to be prophane or vnholy, if I ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they loue &amp; reuerence the word of God, to come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupper of the Lord, &amp;c. For theſe God hath receaued, &amp; counteth them righteous thorough the remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes: to him they ſtand or fall. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, with great reioyſing I geue thankes to God, for that he hath abundantly and aboue meaſure graunted that vnto me, which I ſo earneſtly deſired of him when I was a Monke: For he hath geuen vnto me the grace to ſee, not one but many Sainctes, yea an infinite nomber of true ſainctes: not ſuch as the Sophiſters haue deuiſed, but ſuch as Chriſte himſelfe &amp; his Apoſtles doe deſcribe. Of the which nomber I aſſure my ſelfe to be one. For I am baptiſed,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:9456:261"/>
and I doe beleue that Chriſt my Lord by his death hath redemed and deliuered me from all my ſinnes, and hath geuen to me eternall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and holines. And let him be holden accurſed, who ſo euer ſhall not geue this honour vnto Chriſte, to beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by his death, his word, &amp;c. he is iuſtified and ſanctified.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore, reiecting this fooliſh and wicked opinion concerning the name of Saincts (which in the time of Poperie and ignorance we thought to pertaine onely to the Sainctes which are in heauen, and in earth to the Heremites and Monkes which did certaine great and ſtraunge workes): let vs now learne by the holy Scripture that all they which faithfully beleue in Chriſt are Saincts. The world hath in great admiration the holines of <hi>Benedict, Gregorie, Bernard,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Al the faithful be Sainctes.</note> 
                        <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and ſuch like, becauſe it heareth that they haue done in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and in the iudgement of the world, certaine great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent workes. Doutles <hi>Hyllarie, Cyrill, Athanaſius, Ambroſe, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> and others were Saincts alſo, which liued not ſo ſtrait and ſeuere a life as they did, but were conuerſant amongs men, and did eate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meates, drunke wine, and vſed clenly and comely apparell, ſo that in a maner there was no difference betwene them &amp; other honeſt men as touching the common cuſtome, and the vſe of things neceſſary for this life, and yet were they to be preferred farre aboue the other. Theſe men taught the doctrine and faith of Chriſte ſincerely &amp; purely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuperſtition: they reſiſted heretikes, they purged the church from innumerable errours: their company and familiaritie was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to many, and ſpecially to thoſe which were afflicted and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie harted, whom they raiſed vppe and comforted by the word of God. For they did not withdraw them ſelues from the company of men, but they executed their offices euen where moſt reſort of people was. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, the other not onely taught many things contrary to the Faith, but alſo were themſelues the authors &amp; firſt inuentours of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuperſtitions, errours, abhominable ceremonies and wicked wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippings. Therefore except at the houre of death they laid hold of Chriſte, and repoſed their whole truſt in his death and victorie, theyr ſtrait and painfull life auailed them nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things ſufficiently declare who be the true Sainctes in deede, and which is to be called a holy life:<note place="margin">A holy life.</note> Not the life of thoſe which lurke in caues &amp; dennes, which make their bodies leane with faſting, which weare hear, and doe other like things with this perſwaſion and truſt, that they ſhall haue ſome ſingular reward in heauen aboue all
<pb facs="tcp:9456:262"/>
other Chriſtians: but of thoſe which be baptiſed and beleue in Chriſt, which put of the olde man with his workes, but not at once: For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence and luſt remaineth in them ſo long as they liue: the feeling wherof doth hurt them nothing at all, if they ſuffer it not to raigne in them, but ſubdue it to the ſpirite.</p>
                     <p>This doctrine bringeth great conſolation to godly mindes, that when they feele theſe dartes of the fleſh, wherewith Sathan aſſaileth the ſpirite, they ſhould not deſpaire: As it hapneth to many in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, which thought that they ought to feele no concupiſcence of the fleſh, where as notwithſtanding <hi>Hierome, Gregorie, Benedict, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> and others (whom the Monks ſet before them as a perfect exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of chaſtitie and of all Chriſtian vertues) could neuer come ſo farre as to feele no concupiſcence or luſt of the fleſh. Yea they felt it and that very ſtrongly. Which thing they acknowledge and plainly confeſſe in diuers places of their bookes.</p>
                     <p>Therfore we rightly confeſſe in the articles of our beleefe, that we beleue there is a holy Church.<note place="margin">I beleue that there is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church.</note> For it is inuiſible, dwelling in ſpirit in a place that none can attaine vnto, and therefore her holines can not be ſeene: For God doth ſo hide and couer her with infirmities, with ſinnes, with errours, with diuers formes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe and offences, that according to the iudgement of reaſon it is no where to be ſeene. They that are ignorant of this, when they ſee the infirmities and ſinnes of thoſe which are baptiſed, which haue the word and beleue it: are by and by offended, and iudge them not to pertaine to the Church. And in the meane while they dreame that the Heremites, the Monks and ſuch other ſhauelings are the church: which honour God with their lippes, and worſhip him in vaine, becauſe they folow not the word of God, but the doctrines and commaundements of men, &amp; teach others to doe the ſame. And becauſe they doe certaine ſuperſtitious and monſtrous works, which carnal reaſon magnifieth and highly eſtemeth: therfore they iudge them only to be Saincts and to be the church: And in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they chaunge and turne this article of the Faith cleane contrary: I beleue that there is a holy church.<note place="margin">I do not ſee, but I beleue.</note> &amp;c. and in the ſteede of this word [I beleue] they put in [I ſee]. Theſe kinds of righteouſnes &amp; holines of mans owne deuiſing,<note place="margin">Hypocriticall holines.</note> are nothing elſe but ſpiritual ſorceries wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyes &amp; minds of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are blinded &amp; led fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of true holines.</p>
                     <p>But thus teach we, that the Church hath no ſpot nor wrinkle, but is holy, and yet through Faith onely in Chriſt Ieſus: Againe, that ſhe is holy in life and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation by abſtaining from the luſts of the fleſh,<note place="margin">The church is holy.</note>

and exerciſe of ſpirituall works: but yet not in ſuch ſort that he is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from all euill deſires, or purged from all wicked opinions and errours.

Let Chriſtians then endeuour to auoide the workes of the fleſh: but the deſires or luſtes of the fleſh they can not auoide.</p>
                     <p>It is very profitable therfore for them to feele the vncleane luſtes of the fleſh,<note place="margin">To feele the vnclennes of the flesh is profitable.</note> leſt they ſhould be puffed vp with ſome vaine &amp; wicked opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the righteouſnes of their owne works, as though they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted before God for the ſame.

Wherfore doe your endeuour with diligence, that ye may diſcerne and rightly iudge betwene true righteouſnes or holines, and that which is hypocriticall: then ſhall ye behold the kingdom of Chriſt with other eyes then carnall reaſon doth, that is, with ſpirituall eyes, and certainly iudge thoſe to be true Sainctes in deede which are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed and beleue in Chriſte, and afterwardes in the ſame Faith wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are iuſtified and their ſinnes both paſt and preſent are forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, doe abſtaine from the deſires of the fleſh. But from theſe deſires they are not thorowly clenſed: for the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirite. Notwithſtanding theſe vncleane &amp; rebellious luſtes doe ſtill remaine in them, to this ende that they may be humbled, and being ſo humbled, they may feele the ſweetenes of the grace and benefite of Chriſte. So theſe remnauntes of vncleane luſtes and ſinnes doe nothing at all hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">To the godly thoſe things vvhich are euil, turne vnto good.</note> but greatly furder the godly: For the more they feele their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and ſinnes, ſo much the more they flie vnto Chriſte the throne of grace, and more heartely craue his aide and ſuccour: to witte, that he will couer them with his righteouſnes, that he will encreaſe their Faith, that he will endue them with his holy ſpirite, by whoſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous leading and guiding they may ouercome the luſts of the fleſh, that they rule &amp; raigne not ouer them, but may be ſubiect vnto them.

And albeit that this place may be vnderſtand of the workes of this life or ciuill conuerſation, yet principally the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the worke of the miniſtery, and inueyeth againſt thoſe vaineglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heads, which with their fantaſticall opinions doe trouble well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed conſciences.</p>
                  <p>And this is the property of thoſe which are infected w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this poyſon of vainglory,<note place="margin">Vainglorious heades.</note> that they haue no regard whether their worke, that is to ſay, their miniſtery be pure, ſimple &amp; faithfull or not: but this they only ſeeke that they may haue the praiſe of the people. So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſe apoſtles, when they ſaw that <hi>Paule</hi> preached the goſpel purely to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and that they could not bring any better doctrine, they began to finde fault at thoſe things which he had godly &amp; faithfully taught, &amp; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their owne doctrine before the doctrine of <hi>Paule,</hi> &amp; by this ſubtiltie they wonne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fauour of the Galathians, &amp; brought <hi>Paule</hi> into hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.

And thirdly when they haue once gotten a name (though it be by other mens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile) they become ſo ſtout and full of ſtomacke that they dare venture vpon all things. Therefore they are pernicious and peſtilent felowes, whom I hate euen with my very heart: for they ſeeke their owne, and not that which is of Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.27.</note> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Againſt ſuch <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh here. As if he ſhould ſay: Such vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious ſpirites do their worke, that is to ſay, they teach the Goſpell to this ende that they may winne praiſe &amp; eſtimation among men, that is, that they may be counted excellent doctors, with whom <hi>Paule</hi> and others might not be compared.

                  <p>Thus it ought not to be (ſayth he): but let euery man be faithfull in his office: let him not ſeeke his owne glory, nor depende vppon the praiſe &amp; commendation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, but let his only care be to doe his worke truly, that is, let him teach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel purely.<note place="margin">He shall lacke no praiſe that preacheth the Goſpel purely</note> And if his worke be ſincere &amp; ſound, let him aſſure him ſelfe that he ſhall lacke no praiſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before God or among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly.

He leaneth not to the praiſe of other men, for he hath it in him ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore he that truly &amp; faithfully executeth his office, careth not what the world ſpeake of him: he careth not whether the world praiſe or diſpraiſe him, but he hath praiſe in himſelfe,<note place="margin">To haue praiſe in himſelfe.</note> which is the teſtimonie of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience and praiſe or glory in God.

                  <p>And this admonition is very neceſſary againſt that execrable vice of vaineglory.<note place="margin">The Goſpell is the vvord of the croſſe and offence. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18.</note> The Goſpel is a doctrine which both of it ſelfe, and alſo by the malice of the Deuill bringeth with it the croſſe and perſecution.

They ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that teach the Goſpell to the end that they may obtaine the fauour and praiſe of men, muſt needes periſh and their glory be turned vnto ſhame when the people ceaſe to reuerence and magnifie them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all paſtours and miniſters of the word learne to haue glory and reioyſing in them ſelues, and not in the mouth of other men. If there be any that praiſe them, as the godly are wont to doe <hi>(By euill report

and good report ſaith Paule):</hi> yet let them receaue this glory but as a ſhadow of true glory: and let them thinke the ſubſtance of glory to be in deede the teſtimonie of their owne conſcience. He that doth ſo, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his owne workd, that is, he regardeth not his owne glory, but his only care is to do his office faithfully, that is to ſay, to teach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpell purely, &amp; to ſhew the true vſe of the Sacraments.<note place="margin">VVhat it is for a man to proue his ovvne vvork.</note> When he thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his owne worke, he hath glory and reioyſing in himſelf, which no man can take from him: for he hath it ſurely planted and grounded in his owne heart, &amp; not in other mens mouthes: whom Sathan can ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſily turne away, and can make that mouth and tounge now full of curſſing, which a little before was full of bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>Therfore (ſayth <hi>Paule</hi>) if ye be deſirous of glory, ſeeke it where it ſhould be ſought, not in the mouth of other men, but in your owne heart: which ye then doe when ye execute your office truely and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.

<pb facs="tcp:9456:277"/>
Therfore thought I that <hi>Paule</hi> had commaunded this in vaine, ſeeing that all maner of good things were not only abundantly geuen to the Cleargie, but alſo they ouerflowed in wealth and riches. Wherfore I thought that men ought rather to be exhorted to withhold their hands from geuing, then encouraged to geue any more: for I ſawe that by this exceſſiue liberalitie of men, the couetouſnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cleargie did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.

But this is the lotte of the Goſpel when it is preached, that not onely no man is willing to geue any thing for the finding of miniſters and maintaining of ſcholers, but men begin to ſpoyle, to robbe and to ſteale, and with diuers craftie meanes one to beguile an other.

                  <p>Now therefore we begin to vnderſtand how neceſſary this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of <hi>Paule</hi> is as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maintenaunce of the miniſters of the Church.

And Sathan helpeth forwardes this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enormitie by vngodly Magiſtrates in the Cities, and alſo by noble men and gentlemen in the countrey, who take away the church goods whereby the miniſters of the Goſpell ſhould liue, and turne them to wicked vſes.<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

ſeemeth to auouch in this place. As touching ſuch ſentences which ſpeake of workes and the reward of them, we haue treated very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before in the .5. chapter. And very neceſſary it is, after the example of <hi>Paule,</hi> to exhort the faithfull to good workes, that is to ſay, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their faith by good workes. For if they folow not faith, it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt token that their Faith is no true faith. Therefore the Apoſtle ſayth: <hi>He that ſovveth in the flesh</hi> (ſome vnderſtand it, in his owne fleſh), that is to ſay, he that geueth nothing to the miniſters of Gods word, but onely feedeth and careth for him ſelfe (which is the counſell of the fleſh) that man ſhall of the fleſh reape corruption, not onely in this preſent life, but alſo in the life to come. For the goods of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall waſt away, and they them ſelues alſo at length ſhall ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully periſh. The Apoſtle would faine ſtirre vp his hearers to be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and beneficiall towards their paſtours and preachers. But what a miſery is it, that the peruerſenes and ingratitude of men ſhould be ſo great, that the churches ſhould neede this admonition?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Encratites</hi> abuſed this place for the confirmation of their wicked opinion againſt mariage, expounding it after this maner:<note place="margin">The heretikes called <hi>Encra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites:</hi> VVhoſe errour the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, and therfore they may cruely be called nevv Encratites.</note> He that ſoweth in the fleſh ſhall reape corruption: that is to ſay, he that marieth a wife ſhall be damned: <hi>Ergo</hi> a wife is a damnable thing, and mariage is euill, for as much as there is in it a ſowing in the fleſh. Theſe beaſtes were ſo deſtitute of all iudgement, that they perceiued not whereabout the Apoſtle went. I ſpeake this to the ende ye may ſee how eaſily the Deuill by his miniſters can turne away the heartes of the ſimple from the truth. <hi>Germanie</hi> ſhall ſhortly haue an infinite number of ſuch beaſtes, yea and already hath very many: For on the one ſide it perſecuteth and killeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly miniſters, and on the other ſide it neglecteth and deſpiſeth them, and ſuffereth them to liue in great penurie. Let vs arme our ſelues againſt theſe and ſuch like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and let vs learne to know the true meaning of the Scriptures. For <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh not here of matrimonie, but of nouriſhing the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the church, which euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is endued but with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon iudgement of reaſon may perceaue.

                  <p>Theſe falſe teachers being accuſed of the Apoſtle for three ſuch execrable enormities, were worthy to be auoided of all men.

And I am crucified to the world, that is: the world againe iudgeth me to be damned. Thus we crucifie and condemne one an other. I abhorre all the doctrine, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes and works of the world as the poyſon of the Deuil. The world againe deteſteth my doctrine and deedes, and iudgeth me to be a ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, a pernicious, a peſtilent felow, and an heretike. So at this day the world is crucified to vs, and we vnto the world. We curſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all mans traditions concerning Maſſes, Orders, vowes, wil-worſhippings, works, &amp; all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abhominations of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope &amp; other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, as the dirt of the Deuill. They againe do perſecute &amp; kill vs as deſtroyers of religion and troublers of the publike peace.</p>
                  <p>The Monkes dreamed that the world was crucified to them when they entred into their Monaſteries: but by this meanes Chriſt is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and not the world, yea the world is deliuered from crucifying
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:9456:283"/>
and is the more quickened by that opinion of holines and truſt which they had in their owne righteouſnes that entred into religion. Moſt fooliſhly &amp; wickedly therfore was this ſentence of the Apoſtle wreſted to the entring into Monaſteries.<note place="margin">The contrary iudgement of the faithful &amp; of the vvorld as concerning true doctrine.</note> He ſpeaketh here of an high matter &amp; of great importance: that is to ſay, that euery faithfull man iudgeth that to be the wiſedom, righteouſnes and power of God, which the world condemneth as the greateſt folly, wickednes and weaknes. And contrariwiſe, that which the world iudgeth to be the higheſt religion and ſeruice of God, the faithfull doe know to be nothing elſe but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable and horrible blaſphemie againſt God. So the godly condemne the world, and againe the world condemneth the godly. But the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue the right iudgement on their ſide:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.13.</note> for the ſpirituall man iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth all things.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the iudgement of the world touching religion and righteouſnes before God, is as contrary to the iudgement of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as God and the Deuill are contrary the one to the other. For as God is crucified to the Deuill and the Deuill to God: that is to ſay,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.8.</note> as God condemneth the doctrine and workes of the Deuill (for the Sonne of God appeared, as Iohn ſayth,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8.44.</note> to deſtroy the workes of the Deuill): and contrariwiſe the Deuill condemneth and ouerthroweth the word and the workes of God, for he is murtherer and the father of lies: ſo the world condemneth the doctrine and life of the godly,<note place="margin">The vvorld condemneth the life and doctrine of the godly.</note> calling them moſt pernicious heretikes and troublers of the publike peace. And againe, the faithfull call the world the ſonne of the Deuil, which rightly foloweth his fathers ſteppes, that is to ſay, which is as great a murtherer and lier as his father is. This is <hi>Paules</hi> meaning when he ſayth: <hi>vvhereby the vvorld is crucified to me and I vnto the vvorld.</hi> Now, the world doth not onely ſignifie in the Scriptures vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and wicked men, but the very beſt, the wiſeſt and holieſt men that are of the world.</p>
                  <p>And here by the way he couertly toucheth the falſe apoſtles. As if he ſhould ſay: I vtterly hate and deteſt all glory which is without the croſſe of Chriſt, as a curſed thing: for the world with all the glory thereof is crucified to me and I to the world. Wherefore accurſed be all they which glory in your fleſh and not in the croſſe of Chriſt. <hi>Paule</hi> therefore witneſſeth by theſe wordes that he hateth the world with a perfect hatred of the holy Ghoſt: and againe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.22.</note> the world hateth him with a perfect hatred of a wicked ſpirite. As if he ſhould ſay: It is impoſſible that there ſhould be any agreement betweene me and the

world. What ſhall I then doe? ſhall I geue place &amp; teach thoſe things which pleaſe the world? No: but with a ſtout courage I will ſet my ſelfe againſt it, and will as well deſpiſe and crucifie it, as it deſpiſeth and crucifieth me.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, <hi>Paule</hi> here teacheth how we ſhould fight againſt Sathan (which not onely tormenteth our bodies w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſundry afflictions, but alſo woundeth our hearts continually with his fiery dartes,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.16.</note> that by this continuance, when he can no otherwiſe preuaile, he may ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw our faith, &amp; bring vs from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth &amp; from Chriſt), namely that like as we ſee <hi>Paule</hi> him ſelfe to haue ſtoutly deſpiſed the world: ſo we alſo ſhould deſpiſe the Deuill the Prince therof, with all his force, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits &amp; helliſh furies, and ſo truſting to the aide and helpe of Chriſte, ſhould triumph againſt him after this maner: O Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the more thou hurteſt and goeſt about to hurt me, the more proud and ſtout I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and laugh thee to ſcorne.

                  <p>Reaſon and the wiſedom of the fleſh doth not vnderſtand this: <hi>for it perceiueth not thoſe things vvhich are of the ſpirit of God.</hi>

                  <p>And by theſe two things: Circumciſion &amp; vncircumciſion, <hi>Paule</hi> reiecteth al other things what ſo euer, and denieth that they auaile any thing in Chriſt Ieſu, that is, in the cauſe of faith and ſaluation.

Alſo, whatſoeuer the Iewes are able to do, with their <hi>Moiſes,</hi> their law, their circumciſion, their worſhippings, their temple, their kingdom and prieſthoode, it nothing auaileth. Wherefore in Chriſt Ieſu or in the matter of Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication we muſt not diſpute of the lawes either of the Gentiles or of the Iewes, but we muſt ſimply pronounce that neither circumciſion nor vncircumciſion auaileth any thing.</p>

                  <p>This he addeth as a concluſion.<note place="margin">A right rule.</note> This is the onely and true rule wherin we ought to walke, namely the new creature, which is neither circumciſion nor vncircumciſion,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.24.</note> but the new man created vnto the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God in righteouſnes &amp; true holines, which inwardly is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the ſpirite, and outwardly is holy and cleane in the fleſh. The Monkes haue a righteouſnes and holines,<note place="margin">The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of Monkes.</note> but it is hypocriticall and wicked, becauſe they hope not to be iuſtified by onely faith in Chriſte, but by the keping of their Rule. Moreouer, although outwardly they counterfet an holines, and refraine their eyes, handes, tounge &amp; other members from euill: yet they haue an vncleane heart, ful of filthy luſt, enuie, wrath, lecherie, idolatrie, contempt and hatred of God, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie againſt Chriſte, &amp;c. for they are moſt ſpitefull and cruell enemies of the truth. Wherefore the Rule and religion of the Monkes is moſt wicked, and accurſed of God.</p>
                  <p>But this rule whereof <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh in this place, is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb facs="tcp:9456:286"/>
by the which we liue in the Faith of Chriſte, and are made newe creatures, that is to ſay, righteous and holy in deede by the holy ghoſt, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any colouring or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfetting. To them which walke after this rule belongeth peace,<note place="margin">Peace.

Yea although they which walke after this rule be ouertaken with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinne, yet for that they are the children of grace and peace, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy vpholdeth them, ſo that their ſinne and fall ſhall not be layd vnto their charge.</p>

At a word, this is my cenſure, that Chriſte which I haue preached is the onely high Prieſt and Sauiour of the world.

                  <p>This is the true meaning of this place: The markes that be in my body doe ſhew well enough whoſe ſeruaunt I am.
